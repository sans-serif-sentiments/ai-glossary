short_def: Process of selecting relevant documents or vectors from a corpus in response
  to a query.
long_def: 'Retrieval refers to the algorithms and infrastructure that locate the most
  relevant pieces of information when a user submits a query. Classical approaches
  use lexical signals like TF-IDF and BM25, while modern systems incorporate dense
  vector similarity, hybrid combinations, and reranking models tailored to the domain.
  Retrieval quality underpins search, question answering, and retrieval-augmented
  generation workflows: without high recall and precision, downstream models hallucinate
  or return stale policy guidance. Engineers design retrievers by choosing chunking
  strategies, embedding models, index types, and freshness policies. They also monitor
  latency, relevance metrics, and guardrails such as filtering sensitive content.
  Governance teams treat retrieval pipelines as data processors, verifying access
  controls, audit logging, and compliance with data minimization requirements. Strong
  retrieval discipline enables traceability by linking generated outputs back to cited
  sources.'
audiences:
  exec: Retrieval is the step that fetches trusted facts before the AI speaks, keeping
    answers grounded.
  engineer: Implements query encoding, similarity search, and ranking to surface high-relevance
    passages for downstream consumers.
examples:
  do:
  - Track recall@k and precision metrics separately to diagnose retrieval bottlenecks.
  dont:
  - Index sensitive documents without permissioning or automated redaction.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - data_quality
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Weak retrieval controls can expose restricted records or feed outdated
    content into regulated workflows.
