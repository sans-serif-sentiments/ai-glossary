short_def: Strategy that selects the highest-probability token at each step, producing
  deterministic outputs.
long_def: 'Greedy decoding generates text by repeatedly choosing the token with the
  maximum probability, skipping any sampling. The approach is deterministic, fast,
  and easy to reason about, which makes it attractive for scenarios that demand consistency
  or auditability. However, it can lead to repetitive phrasing, premature endings,
  or failure to explore alternative but valid continuations. Product teams deploy
  greedy decoding for transactional tasks such as structured responses, deterministic
  workflows, or template filling, where creativity is less important than reliability.
  Engineers monitor for mode collapse and may add techniques like repetition penalties
  or suffix constraints to mitigate degenerate loops. Governance teams value greedy
  decoding because it simplifies compliance reviews and reproducibility: the same
  prompt always yields the same answer. Nonetheless, the lack of variation can hide
  blind spots if evaluations rely solely on argmax outputs, so organizations often
  complement greedy decoding tests with sampling-based stress cases.'
audiences:
  exec: Greedy decoding delivers the same answer every time, prioritizing consistency
    over creativity.
  engineer: Iteratively pick the argmax token from the softmax distribution, allowing
    deterministic, low-latency generation.
examples:
  do:
  - Use greedy decoding for policy disclosures where text must match approved language.
  dont:
  - Rely on greedy decoding alone when testing for harmful edge cases that require
    sampling diversity.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Deterministic decoding simplifies audits but can mask untested behaviors
    that appear only with sampling.
