part_of_speech: noun_phrase
short_def: Action plan that tracks risks, mitigations, owners, and timelines for an
  AI deployment.
long_def: An impact mitigation plan documents the risks identified during assessments,
  the mitigation steps the organization will take, and the owners accountable for
  each action. It connects findings from algorithmic impact assessments, red-team
  exercises, and audits to specific deadlines, metrics, and escalation triggers. Policy
  leads maintain the plan to satisfy regulatory expectations, product teams map mitigations
  to launch gates, and engineering tracks the technical work needed to close gaps.
  When kept current, the plan provides a single source of truth for audits and post-incident
  reviews. When neglected, risks stay unaddressed and stakeholders lose visibility
  into whether controls are actually landing.
audiences:
  exec: Use the mitigation plan to monitor whether high-severity risks are closing
    before committing to launch dates.
  engineer: Link each mitigation to backlog tickets and telemetry so progress stays
    measurable and auditable.
examples:
  do:
  - Record status updates and evidence links for every mitigation before major launch
    reviews.
  - Flag blocked mitigations with escalation paths and decision deadlines for leadership.
  dont:
  - Let mitigation owners slip without documenting rationale or alternate controls.
  - Track mitigations in private spreadsheets that governance teams cannot access.
