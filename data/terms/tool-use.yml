part_of_speech: process
short_def: Pattern where a model selects external tools or functions to handle parts
  of a task.
long_def: 'Tool use occurs when a language model defers specific subtasks to external
  functions, APIs, or agents that it selects based on the conversation. Platforms
  expose structured schemas describing available tools—such as search, retrieval,
  math, or workflow actions—and the model predicts when and how to call them. This
  architecture extends model capabilities beyond text generation, supporting grounded
  answers, transactions, and integrations with enterprise systems. Engineers design
  tool contracts, manage authentication, and implement result formatting so outputs
  slot back into the conversation. Product owners document which tools are enabled
  per experience and define escalation paths when tools fail. Governance teams treat
  tool catalogs as controlled assets: they require access reviews, logging, and guardrails
  to prevent unauthorized actions or data leakage. When implemented responsibly, tool
  use increases accuracy and reduces hallucinations, but it also introduces new attack
  surfaces and compliance obligations.'
audiences:
  exec: Tool use lets the assistant call trusted services—think search or ticketing—to
    deliver accurate, actionable answers.
  engineer: Expose structured tool specs, let the model emit JSON arguments, execute
    the function, and feed results back into the dialogue loop.
examples:
  do:
  - Log every tool invocation with inputs and outputs for auditing and debugging.
  dont:
  - Expose production tools without rate limits or abuse monitoring.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Poorly governed tool catalogs can trigger unauthorized actions or leak
    sensitive data through function interfaces.
