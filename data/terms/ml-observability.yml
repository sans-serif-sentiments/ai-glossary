part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Practices and tooling that surface model health through metrics, traces,
  and alerts across the lifecycle.
long_def: ML observability applies observability principles to machine learning systems,
  collecting signals that describe data quality, model behavior, infrastructure health,
  and user outcomes. The discipline unifies telemetry such as latency, throughput,
  drift metrics, guardrail triggers, and human feedback so teams can diagnose issues
  quickly. Robust observability stacks ingest logs from preprocessing, inference,
  retrieval, and post-processing stages, correlating them with experiment metadata
  and deployment versions. Product owners reference observability dashboards to understand
  adoption and satisfaction, while engineers rely on them to root-cause regressions
  and capacity incidents. Governance programs require observable pipelines to demonstrate
  compliance with monitoring expectations in frameworks like the NIST AI RMF. Without
  observability, organizations struggle to detect bias, hallucinations, or safety
  incidents before they impact users. Investing in standardized logging, alerting,
  and runbooks enables proactive triage and continuous improvement.
audiences:
  exec: ML observability provides the dashboards and alerts that show whether AI systems
    remain healthy and trustworthy.
  engineer: Collect metrics, logs, and traces across data, model, and infra layers;
    stitch them to deployments for debugging and compliance.
examples:
  do:
  - Correlate drift alerts with retrieval metrics to pinpoint whether failures stem
    from data or model changes.
  dont:
  - Disable guardrail logging due to cost; missing records breaks incident response
    and compliance.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - monitoring
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Insufficient observability hides safety incidents and undermines regulatory
    reporting obligations.
