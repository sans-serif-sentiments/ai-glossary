part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Labeled examples the model learns from before it ever sees validation or
  test inputs.
long_def: Training data is the portion of the dataset used to fit model parameters.
  These examples expose the algorithm to the signals it should internalize, from class
  boundaries to feature interactions. High-quality training data mirrors the production
  environment, includes the right balance of cohorts, and has documented provenance
  so teams can trace issues. Engineers tune hyperparameters and optimization steps
  against this split, while product partners track which customer or policy scenarios
  are represented. Weak training data leads to brittle models that memorize quirks
  rather than patterns, increasing the odds of bias, regressions, and governance failures
  when the system is deployed.
audiences:
  exec: Training data is the fuel that teaches the model what "good" looks like before
    launch.
  engineer: Curate representative, versioned examples with clear labels; document
    preprocessing and access controls.
examples:
  do:
  - Record data lineage and consent before moving samples into the training set.
  - Refresh training data when product usage, markets, or regulations shift.
  dont:
  - Mix evaluation samples back into training without resetting benchmark baselines.
  - Ignore gaps in protected classes or edge scenarios that appear in production.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - data_quality
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Poorly governed training data creates hidden bias and auditing gaps
    that surface as fairness or compliance incidents.
