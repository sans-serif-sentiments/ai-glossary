part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Mathematical rule that scores how far model predictions deviate from desired
  targets.
long_def: A loss function translates model performance into a single scalar so optimisation
  algorithms know which direction to move. Classification systems rely on cross-entropy
  or focal loss to punish incorrect labels, while regression models often use mean
  squared error or Huber loss to balance sensitivity to outliers. Product and policy
  partners read loss definitions to understand which business or compliance outcomes
  the model optimises, and engineers adjust them when priorities shift from accuracy
  to calibration, fairness, or cost. Clear documentation of the loss function protects
  teams from accidental regressions, especially when a model serves multiple stakeholders
  who care about different metrics.
audiences:
  exec: The loss function is the scorecard that tells the training loop if changes
    made the model better or worse.
  engineer: Define differentiable losses aligned with business metrics; monitor surrogate
    vs. offline KPI gaps and adjust weighting as needed.
examples:
  do:
  - Document the exact loss, weighting, and class balancing strategy in model cards
    and runbooks.
  - Evaluate fairness metrics alongside the chosen loss before updating production
    thresholds.
  dont:
  - Swap in a new loss function without revalidating calibration and downstream KPIs.
  - Optimise purely for training loss when evaluation or business metrics tell a different
    story.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Misaligned losses can optimise for the wrong behaviour, creating governance
    or compliance gaps if not reviewed.
