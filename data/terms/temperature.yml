part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Decoding parameter that controls how random or deterministic a model’s
  outputs are.
long_def: Temperature adjusts the softness of the probability distribution used when
  sampling tokens during decoding. A low temperature sharpens the distribution so
  the model consistently chooses the highest-probability token, producing deterministic,
  conservative responses. Higher temperatures flatten the distribution, increasing
  the likelihood of picking lower-probability tokens that introduce creativity but
  also raise the risk of incoherence or policy violations. Product teams tune temperature
  per use case—customer support bots typically prefer lower settings, while brainstorming
  assistants tolerate higher ones. Engineers may pair temperature with top-k or nucleus
  sampling to constrain randomness while preserving diversity. Governance reviewers
  monitor temperature configurations because overly permissive settings can bypass
  guardrails validated at default values, leading to unpredictable behavior in production.
  Documenting temperature choices and evaluating them against safety scenarios is
  therefore part of responsible deployment.
audiences:
  exec: Temperature is the creativity dial—turn it down for consistency, up for variety.
  engineer: Softmax scaling factor applied prior to sampling; inversely proportional
    to distribution sharpness and deterministic behavior.
examples:
  do:
  - Run evaluation suites at multiple temperature settings to quantify factual accuracy
    trade-offs.
  dont:
  - Ship higher temperatures to production without revisiting safety and compliance
    test results.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - robustness
  - transparency
  risk_notes: High temperatures can invalidate prior safety assessments and increase
    hallucination incidents.
