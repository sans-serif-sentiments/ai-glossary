part_of_speech: process
short_def: Process for measuring fidelity, utility, privacy, and bias of synthetic
  datasets before use.
long_def: Synthetic data evaluation verifies that generated datasets mirror the statistical
  properties of real data without leaking sensitive information. Teams measure fidelity
  (distribution similarity), utility (model performance when trained on synthetic
  data), privacy leakage (distance or matching tests), and bias (subgroup balance).
  Evaluations often combine automated metrics—such as Wasserstein distance, nearest-neighbor
  tests, TSTR/TSNT—and human or domain-expert reviews. Product and policy teams review
  results to decide whether synthetic data is acceptable for training, testing, or
  sharing. Documentation should capture evaluation methods, thresholds, and mitigation
  plans when issues arise.
audiences:
  exec: Synthetic data evaluation proves the generated data is both useful and safe
    before we rely on it.
  engineer: Compute fidelity, utility, privacy, and bias metrics; compare against
    acceptance thresholds and log findings with dataset versions.
examples:
  do:
  - Use real-world benchmarks (TSTR) to confirm models trained on synthetic data generalize.
  - Validate privacy leakage with membership inference or nearest-neighbor tests.
  dont:
  - Assume synthetic data is safe without quantitative evaluation.
  - Ignore subgroup representation when assessing utility.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - data_quality
  - privacy
  risk_notes: Poor evaluation can result in biased or leaky synthetic datasets reaching
    production or partners.
