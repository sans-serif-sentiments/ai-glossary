short_def: Metric summarizing binary classifier performance by measuring area under
  the ROC curve.
long_def: ROC AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve) quantifies
  how well a binary classifier separates positive and negative classes across all
  possible decision thresholds. The ROC curve plots the true positive rate against
  the false positive rate; the area under that curve ranges from 0.5 (random) to 1.0
  (perfect). Teams use ROC AUC when class distributions are imbalanced or when threshold
  selection will happen later in the product lifecycle. Engineers analyze the curve’s
  shape to understand trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, while product
  managers compare ROC AUC alongside business-focused metrics before launches. Governance
  and legal stakeholders review ROC AUC for fairness and regulatory reporting to ensure
  classifiers meet minimum performance standards before deployment.
audiences:
  exec: ROC AUC shows how reliably a classifier can distinguish good from bad outcomes
    before you pick a final threshold.
  engineer: Integrate true/false positive rates over thresholds; inspect curve segments
    to diagnose operating points and class imbalance.
examples:
  do:
  - Report ROC AUC alongside precision, recall, and confusion matrices for a holistic
    view.
  - Evaluate ROC AUC per subgroup to detect disparate impact before rollout.
  dont:
  - Rely solely on ROC AUC when decision thresholds are fixed and business costs are
    asymmetric.
  - Compare ROC AUC from different datasets without standardizing splits.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Ignoring ROC AUC trends can hide degradation that leads to unfair or
    unsafe decisions in production.
