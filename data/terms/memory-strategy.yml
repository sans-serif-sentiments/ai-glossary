short_def: Deliberate approach for when an AI agent stores, retrieves, or forgets
  context across tasks.
long_def: A memory strategy defines how an AI agent captures, retrieves, and expires
  contextual information while executing tasks. It balances cost, latency, privacy,
  and safety considerations by deciding which events to persist, where to store them,
  and which signals trigger deletion. Engineers design memory policies to avoid stale
  or sensitive data leaking into future prompts, while product teams ensure the experience
  remains transparent to users. Common patterns include stateless execution, short-term
  scratchpads, vector memory with embeddings, and human-curated summaries. The right
  strategy depends on regulatory constraints, user consent, and the risk tolerance
  for hallucinations or runaway tool use. Without clear guardrails, agents can over-collect
  data, misapply outdated facts, or introduce compliance gaps.
audiences:
  exec: Align on what information the agent keeps so you can set customer trust and
    compliance expectations.
  engineer: Codify storage tiers, retention windows, and redaction rules before wiring
    memory into agent workflows.
examples:
  do:
  - Expire vector memories that include personally identifiable information within
    24 hours unless explicit consent exists.
  - Store only structured summaries of previous steps so downstream prompts stay within
    token and privacy budgets.
  dont:
  - Persist raw chat transcripts indefinitely without auditing for sensitive attributes.
  - Reuse memories from one customer tenant inside another tenant's session.

  risk_notes: Poorly scoped memory increases the blast radius for privacy violations
    and policy noncompliance.
