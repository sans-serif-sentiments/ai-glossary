part_of_speech: noun_phrase
short_def: Structured argument that proves an AI system meets safety and compliance
  expectations.
long_def: An assurance case is a structured, evidence-backed argument that a system
  satisfies defined safety, ethics, and regulatory claims. Borrowed from aviation
  and medical devices, it organizes claims, supporting evidence, and reasoning into
  a traceable hierarchy so reviewers can judge whether an AI system is trustworthy.
  In practice, the case links risk registers, evaluation results, mitigations, and
  operating procedures to each claim. Policy and legal teams determine the claims
  needed for compliance, engineering curates the technical evidence, and product leaders
  maintain change logs so the case stays current across releases. Without a living
  assurance case, it is hard to demonstrate due diligence to regulators or to coordinate
  sign-off across governance bodies.
audiences:
  exec: Use assurance cases to consolidate the evidence your board and regulators
    expect before high-risk launches.
  engineer: Flow evaluation metrics, mitigations, and incident learnings into a single
    structured argument for review.
examples:
  do:
  - Map every top risk in the register to a specific mitigation and evaluation artifact
    within the case.
  - Schedule periodic refreshes so control owners update evidence before expiry.
  dont:
  - Rely on unstructured wikis or slides that obscure which claims the evidence supports.
  - Freeze the case after initial approval, causing drift between documentation and
    production behavior.
