term: content moderation
aliases:
- trust and safety
- policy enforcement
categories:
- Governance & Risk
- Operations & Monitoring
roles:
- policy
- communications
- product
- security
- engineering
part_of_speech: process
short_def: Workflows and tools that review, filter, and act on user-generated content
  to enforce policy.
long_def: Content moderation combines automation, human review, and escalation procedures
  to detect policy violations such as hate speech, harassment, misinformation, or
  disallowed imagery. AI systems often provide the first layer of moderation by classifying
  or scoring content for human queues, requiring careful tuning of precision/recall
  trade-offs. Policy teams define enforcement rules, while communications and legal
  stakeholders handle appeals and transparency reports. Engineering teams maintain
  moderation pipelines, logging, and guardrails; security teams ensure abuse detection
  remains resilient. Effective moderation programs rely on measurement, red-teaming,
  and incident response to adapt to adversarial users and evolving regulations.
audiences:
  exec: Content moderation protects users and the brand by keeping AI outputs and
    user posts within policy.
  engineer: Blend classifiers, heuristic filters, and human review; monitor performance,
    appeals, and adversarial attempts.
examples:
  do:
  - Audit moderation models for bias against protected groups.
  - Publish user-facing guidelines and escalation paths.
  dont:
  - Rely solely on automation without human oversight for edge cases.
  - Ignore feedback loops when policies change.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - risk_management
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Weak moderation exposes users to harm, invites regulatory fines, and
    erodes trust.
