part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Standardized documentation describing a model’s purpose, data, performance,
  and limitations.
long_def: A model card summarizes key information about an AI system, including intended
  use, training data sources, evaluation results (overall and across subgroups), known
  limitations, safety mitigations, and contact points for escalation. Model cards
  support transparency, reproducibility, and compliance by giving stakeholders a shared
  reference that travels with each release. Product managers and engineers co-author
  model cards during the development lifecycle, updating them after retraining, prompt
  changes, or mitigation work. Policy, legal, and communications teams rely on model
  cards to inform disclosures, customer messaging, and regulatory filings. Mature
  organizations treat model cards as living documents stored in version control, with
  automated checks verifying that new releases update relevant sections.
audiences:
  exec: A model card is the product brief that explains what the AI is for, how it
    was built, and where it might misfire.
  engineer: Document data lineage, evaluation metrics, ethical considerations, and
    change history; keep cards versioned alongside code.
examples:
  do:
  - Include subgroup metrics and fairness assessments in every model card.
  - Link to evaluation artifacts, incident history, and responsible AI approvals.
  dont:
  - Publish a model without a card—reviewers and regulators will ask for it.
  - Let model cards go stale; update them whenever prompts or data shift.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - documentation
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Missing or outdated model cards hinder audits and can delay approvals
    or trigger compliance findings.
