short_def: Transforming raw data into model-ready features that improve signal, fairness,
  and maintainability.
long_def: Feature engineering covers the techniques used to convert raw logs, text,
  images, or structured records into inputs a model can learn from. It spans cleaning,
  normalization, aggregation, embedding, and generation of domain-specific indicators.
  Thoughtful feature engineering improves generalization, reduces noise, and encodes
  policy guardrails early in the pipeline. Data scientists prototype feature pipelines,
  engineers productionize them with monitoring and lineage, and product teams align
  feature choices with user journeys and governance constraints. Documented feature
  logic also accelerates audits and root cause analysis when behaviour shifts in production.
audiences:
  exec: Feature engineering is how we turn messy data into reliable signals the model
    can use.
  engineer: Version feature code, validate statistical drift, and partner with governance
    to review sensitive attributes.
examples:
  do:
  - Log transformations and scaling choices alongside the model so they stay in sync
    across environments.
  - Run fairness and privacy checks when introducing features derived from sensitive
    sources.
  dont:
  - Ship handcrafted features without automated tests or lineage traces.
  - Overfit by generating thousands of highly specific features with no regularization
    plan.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - data_quality
  - privacy
  risk_notes: Opaque feature pipelines hide bias, privacy violations, and drift triggers,
    making incidents harder to manage.
