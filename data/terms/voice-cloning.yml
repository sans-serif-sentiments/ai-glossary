part_of_speech: process
short_def: Technique that replicates a person’s voice using generative models trained
  on audio samples.
long_def: 'Voice cloning systems learn a speaker’s vocal characteristics from recorded
  samples and synthesize new speech that mimics that voice. Modern approaches use
  encoder-decoder architectures, diffusion models, or transformer-based TTS pipelines
  conditioned on speaker embeddings. While voice cloning powers accessibility, localization,
  and creative tools, it also raises serious risks: impersonation, fraud, misinformation,
  and consent violations. Product teams must obtain clear user permissions and provide
  safeguards like watermarks or audible disclosures. Legal and policy teams assess
  compliance with biometric privacy laws and emerging deepfake regulations. Security
  groups monitor abuse signals and coordinate rapid takedowns when clones are misused.
  Transparency, usage logs, and red-team exercises are essential for trustworthy deployment.'
audiences:
  exec: Voice cloning lets you generate speech that sounds like a real person—but
    it needs strict guardrails.
  engineer: Extract speaker embeddings, condition neural TTS or diffusion decoders,
    and enforce consent, watermarking, and usage logs.
examples:
  do:
  - Require opt-in consent and verification before training on a person’s voice.
  - Embed inaudible watermarks and provide detection tools to partners.
  dont:
  - Release cloning features without a response plan for malicious use.
  - Store raw recordings longer than necessary or without encryption.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - risk_management
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Misuse of voice cloning can lead to fraud, reputational harm, and regulatory
    penalties; strict access controls and auditing are mandatory.
