part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Principle of limiting data collection, use, and exposure to protect individuals’
  information.
long_def: Privacy in AI systems focuses on controlling how personal or sensitive data
  is collected, processed, and retained. Regulations such as GDPR, CCPA, and sector-specific
  laws establish legal obligations for transparency, consent, minimization, and user
  rights. In machine learning, privacy risks arise from training data, prompts, logs,
  and model outputs that may reveal personal information. Teams mitigate these risks
  through data minimization, access controls, anonymization, synthetic data, and privacy-enhancing
  technologies like differential privacy. Product leaders coordinate privacy reviews
  with legal counsel when launching new features, while engineers implement safeguards
  in data pipelines, storage, and logging. Governance programs track privacy impact
  assessments, retention schedules, and incident response plans. Maintaining rigorous
  privacy practices preserves user trust and avoids regulatory penalties, making it
  a foundational requirement for responsible AI deployments.
audiences:
  exec: Privacy keeps user data protected and ensures AI initiatives comply with laws
    and customer expectations.
  engineer: Limit collection, apply technical controls, and document handling of personal
    data across training and inference workflows.
examples:
  do:
  - Run privacy impact assessments before ingesting new data sources for fine-tuning.
  dont:
  - Log raw prompts that contain personal identifiers without redaction or retention
    limits.

  risk_notes: Weak privacy controls can expose personal data, triggering legal liability
    and loss of trust.
