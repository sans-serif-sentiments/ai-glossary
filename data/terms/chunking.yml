short_def: Splitting source documents into manageable pieces before indexing or feeding
  them to models.
long_def: 'Chunking divides large documents, transcripts, or code repositories into
  smaller segments that fit within a model’s context window and maintain topical coherence.
  Effective chunking balances granularity: slices must be large enough to preserve
  meaning yet small enough to avoid wasting tokens on irrelevant text. Techniques
  include fixed-length windows, semantic segmentation based on headings, and overlap
  strategies that keep shared context between adjacent chunks. In retrieval-augmented
  generation systems, chunking quality directly influences whether relevant passages
  appear in the prompt and whether citations map to recognizable sections. Engineers
  document chunking parameters alongside embedding models so they can reproduce indexes
  and evaluate recall. Governance teams assess chunking for privacy and intellectual
  property concerns, ensuring sensitive data is not inadvertently duplicated or exposed
  beyond its intended audience when recombining chunks.'
audiences:
  exec: Chunking is how we slice big documents so the AI can reason over them without
    losing the thread.
  engineer: Segmentation pipeline defining window size, overlap, and heuristics that
    prepare content for embedding and retrieval.
examples:
  do:
  - Tune chunk size and overlap per document type and validate with retrieval relevance
    tests.
  dont:
  - Use a single chunking strategy for code, policy docs, and conversations without
    benchmarking.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - data_quality
  - privacy
  risk_notes: Poor chunking can duplicate sensitive data or break context needed for
    accurate, compliant answers.
