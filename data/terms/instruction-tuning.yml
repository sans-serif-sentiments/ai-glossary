short_def: Supervised training that teaches models to follow natural-language instructions
  using curated examples.
long_def: Instruction tuning (often called supervised fine-tuning) adapts a pretrained
  model on datasets of prompts and ideal responses so it learns to follow instructions.
  Annotators craft demonstrations that reflect desired tone, safety, and reasoning
  patterns. Engineers run fine-tuning jobs, data scientists manage dataset quality,
  and policy teams ensure instructions encode governance requirements. The process
  is typically the first step before RLHF or other alignment work. Poorly curated
  instruction data can introduce bias, regress safety, or drift from product expectations,
  so teams monitor evaluation metrics and refresh the dataset as policies evolve.
audiences:
  exec: Budget for recurring instruction tuning to keep models aligned with evolving
    strategy.
  engineer: Version datasets, hyperparameters, and evaluation checkpoints for every
    tuning run.
examples:
  do:
  - Label edge cases and refusal scenarios so the model learns safety boundaries.
  - Combine instruction data with role-based tone guidelines for different audiences.
  dont:
  - Assume open-source instruction datasets cover your policy requirements.
  - Overwrite the base model without comparing against prior alignment baselines.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - risk_management
  - measurement
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Uncontrolled tuning can undo prior safety work and confuse governance
    owners.
