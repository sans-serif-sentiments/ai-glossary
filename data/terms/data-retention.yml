part_of_speech: process
short_def: Policies defining how long data is stored, where it lives, and how it is
  deleted.
long_def: Data retention policies specify how long different data types are stored,
  why they are kept, where they reside, and how they are securely deleted. For AI
  systems, retention applies to raw inputs, training datasets, prompt logs, embeddings,
  and evaluation artifacts. Legal and policy teams determine retention limits based
  on regulations and contracts, while engineering and security implement technical
  controls such as automated deletion, encryption, and retention metadata. Product
  managers need visibility into retention rules to communicate with customers and
  plan features that rely on historical data. Documentation of retention schedules
  is often required for privacy impact assessments and audits.
audiences:
  exec: Data retention makes sure we only keep the information we need, for as long
    as we’re allowed.
  engineer: Implement retention tags, automated deletion jobs, and secure archival;
    track compliance with privacy and contractual obligations.
examples:
  do:
  - Document retention periods for each dataset used in training and inference.
  - Verify deletion workflows during audits and incident response drills.
  dont:
  - Keep prompt logs indefinitely without legal approval.
  - Mix data from different retention schedules in the same storage bucket.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - privacy
  - risk_management
  risk_notes: Ignoring retention requirements can lead to regulatory fines, litigation,
    and security incidents.
