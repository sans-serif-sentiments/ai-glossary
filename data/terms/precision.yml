part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Share of predicted positives that are actually correct for a given classifier.
long_def: Precision measures how often a model’s positive predictions are right. It
  is calculated as true positives divided by the sum of true positives and false positives.
  Precision is critical when false positives carry high costs—such as flagging legitimate
  transactions as fraud or routing harmless content to safety reviewers. Product managers
  examine precision alongside recall to balance user trust and coverage, while engineers
  monitor precision across subgroups to detect drift and bias. Governance teams require
  precision reporting in regulated workflows where incorrect flags can create legal
  exposure. Precision is best interpreted in context with other metrics and operational
  goals, since maximizing it alone may reduce recall and harm users the model fails
  to detect.
audiences:
  exec: Precision tells you how many of the alerts the AI raises are actually right.
  engineer: TP / (TP + FP); inspect per-class and per-segment precision, and monitor
    trade-offs with recall and business cost.
examples:
  do:
  - Track precision at the thresholds used in production, not just at 0.5.
  - Compare precision across demographics to uncover unfair false-positive rates.
  dont:
  - Optimize precision without checking the drop in recall.
  - Report a single precision value when different user segments behave differently.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Low precision increases false alarms, eroding trust and causing unnecessary
    interventions.
