short_def: Additional training that adapts a pretrained model to a specific task or
  domain.
long_def: Fine-tuning continues training from a pretrained checkpoint using a curated
  dataset that reflects the target task, tone, or policy. By adjusting weights on
  top of broad foundation knowledge, teams achieve better accuracy and alignment than
  prompt engineering alone. Approaches include supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement
  learning from human feedback, parameter-efficient methods like LoRA, and combinations
  with synthetic data generation. Product leaders plan fine-tuning roadmaps to differentiate
  experiences or enforce brand voice, while engineers manage hyperparameters, data
  balancing, and evaluation suites to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Governance
  stakeholders scrutinize fine-tuning inputs for licensing, privacy, and bias risks,
  requiring documentation of provenance and review sign-offs. Because fine-tuned models
  can drift from base guarantees, organizations version checkpoints, run regression
  tests, and maintain rollback plans to satisfy compliance obligations and operational
  reliability.
audiences:
  exec: Fine-tuning teaches a general model to speak in the organization’s voice and
    handle domain-specific tasks.
  engineer: Continue training a pretrained model on labeled or preference data, tracking
    hyperparameters, evals, and release packaging.
examples:
  do:
  - Store data lineage and evaluation results for every fine-tuned checkpoint before
    deployment.
  dont:
  - Blend proprietary and open datasets without clarifying licenses and usage rights.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - validity
  risk_notes: Uncontrolled fine-tuning can override safety mitigations or introduce
    licensed data without traceability.
