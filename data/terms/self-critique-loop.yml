part_of_speech: process
short_def: Pattern where a model reviews its own outputs, critiques them, and produces
  revisions before responding.
long_def: A self-critique loop introduces an internal review step into an AI workflow.
  After generating an initial answer, the model (or a paired model) evaluates the
  response against instructions, safety policies, or quality rubrics, then revises
  the output. Engineers use the loop to catch hallucinations or policy violations
  automatically, while product teams tune the number of critique iterations to balance
  latency and reliability. Governance partners supply critique prompts that focus
  on harm categories and compliance language. Without clear stop conditions, self-critique
  can increase cost or drift toward repetitive edits, so loops should cap iterations
  and escalate to humans when uncertainty remains high.
audiences:
  exec: Invest in self-critique loops to raise reliability without assigning every
    response to manual review.
  engineer: Instrument critique prompts, scoring, and escalation thresholds to keep
    loops fast and auditable.
examples:
  do:
  - Log critique reasons and revision diffs so policy teams can audit how safety issues
    were resolved.
  - Limit the loop to two or three iterations before escalating to a human reviewer.
  dont:
  - Allow the loop to run indefinitely chasing marginal quality gains.
  - Rely solely on self-critique for high-severity categories without human oversight.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - monitoring
  - risk_management
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Unbounded self-critique can mask uncertain decisions and increase compute
    cost without clear accountability.
