part_of_speech: noun_phrase
short_def: Database optimized to store embeddings and execute similarity search over
  vectors.
long_def: A vector store persists embeddings alongside metadata and exposes similarity
  search primitives such as nearest-neighbor queries, filtering, and hybrid scoring.
  Unlike relational databases, vector stores optimize for high-dimensional distance
  computations, using structures like HNSW graphs, IVF lists, or product quantization
  to balance recall and latency. They are a foundational component of retrieval-augmented
  generation platforms because they resolve which document chunks should accompany
  a prompt. Operational teams monitor vector stores for index freshness, replication,
  and backup coverage, while engineers tune them for sharding strategies, dimensionality
  alignment with embedding models, and filterable metadata schemas. Governance teams
  oversee access controls and deletion workflows to guarantee that personal or regulated
  data can be removed promptly. Properly instrumented vector stores also log which
  records contributed to an answer, supporting audit trails and user-facing citations.
audiences:
  exec: Think of a vector store as the searchable memory that lets AI find related
    knowledge quickly.
  engineer: Specialized database offering ANN search over embedding vectors with metadata
    filters and lifecycle management.
examples:
  do:
  - Align vector dimensionality and distance metrics with the embedding model before
    bulk ingestion.
  dont:
  - Leave vector indexes unversioned, making it impossible to trace which data powered
    a response.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - data_quality
  risk_notes: Lax access controls or deletion policies can expose sensitive embeddings
    or violate retention requirements.
