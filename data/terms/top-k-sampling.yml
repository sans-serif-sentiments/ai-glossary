short_def: Decoding method that samples from the k most probable next tokens to balance
  diversity and control.
long_def: Top-k sampling limits the candidate set during generation to the k tokens
  with the highest probabilities after applying the model’s softmax distribution.
  By discarding the long tail of unlikely options, the technique keeps outputs coherent
  while preserving some variability relative to greedy decoding. Product teams use
  top-k to tune tone and creativity without inviting the unrestricted randomness of
  pure sampling. Engineers choose k values based on experimentation with validation
  prompts, often combining the method with temperature scaling or nucleus sampling
  to fine-tune randomness. Operationally, top-k is simple to implement and deterministic
  when paired with fixed seeds, which supports reproducibility requirements. Governance
  reviewers document chosen k values because they affect the likelihood of unsafe
  or off-policy responses; overly permissive settings can undo safety evaluations
  performed at lower k thresholds. As part of responsible deployment, teams monitor
  how k adjustments interact with guardrails, cost, and quality metrics across releases.
audiences:
  exec: A knob that keeps the model creative but still focused on the best few answers.
  engineer: Truncate the probability distribution to the highest-probability k tokens
    before sampling to manage diversity versus determinism.
examples:
  do:
  - Evaluate customer support flows at k=1, 10, and 40 to understand trade-offs in
    tone and accuracy.
  dont:
  - Increase k in production without rerunning safety and bias evaluations.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - robustness
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Raising k expands behavioral variance and can expose users to unreviewed
    content patterns.
