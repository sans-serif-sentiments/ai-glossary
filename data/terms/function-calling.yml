part_of_speech: process
short_def: LLM capability that lets prompts invoke predefined functions and return
  structured arguments.
long_def: Function calling bridges natural language prompts and executable tools.
  Developers describe approved functions—such as retrieval queries, database lookups,
  or workflow automations—in a schema the model can reason about. During inference
  the model decides whether to call a function, fills the arguments with structured
  JSON, and uses the tool's response to continue the conversation. Product teams rely
  on function calling to chain RAG pipelines, trigger actions, or enforce form validation
  while keeping humans in the loop for sensitive steps. Robust implementations include
  guardrails on which functions are exposed, argument validation, and logging so security
  and compliance teams can audit usage. When paired with agent frameworks, function
  calling becomes the backbone for orchestrating multi-step tasks.
audiences:
  exec: Function calling lets assistants take reliable actions by routing model suggestions
    into vetted business APIs.
  engineer: Expose idempotent, well-typed functions, validate arguments, and loop
    tool responses back into the conversation state.
examples:
  do:
  - Start with read-only functions and add write access only after logging and approval
    workflows exist.
  dont:
  - Expose unrestricted shell commands or production secrets as callable functions.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Unrestricted function catalogs can let models trigger unsafe actions
    without audit trails.
