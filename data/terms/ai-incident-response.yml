part_of_speech: process
short_def: Coordinated workflow for detecting, triaging, and remediating harmful or
  out-of-policy AI behavior.
long_def: AI incident response adapts traditional incident management to the unique
  risks of machine learning systems. It defines how teams detect unusual behavior,
  declare incidents, assemble cross-functional responders, communicate with stakeholders,
  and deploy mitigations or rollbacks. Triggers include safety violations, hallucinations
  with material impact, security breaches, or regulatory inquiries. Effective programs
  maintain runbooks that cover data isolation, prompt freezes, feature flags, and
  guardrail adjustments. Product, engineering, legal, and communications partners
  collaborate to assess severity, user impact, and reporting obligations. Governance
  frameworks expect documented incident response procedures with clear owners and
  timelines, particularly for high-risk deployments. After-action reviews capture
  learnings that feed back into evaluation suites, prompts, and monitoring. Without
  a disciplined incident response plan, organizations risk delayed containment, regulatory
  penalties, and erosion of user trust.
audiences:
  exec: AI incident response is the playbook that keeps harm contained and stakeholders
    informed when something goes wrong.
  engineer: Detect anomalies, page the on-call rotation, freeze risky components,
    and coordinate fixes across data, model, and infra teams.
examples:
  do:
  - Run quarterly tabletop exercises to rehearse AI incident response workflows.
  dont:
  - Silence alerts or skip postmortems once an incident is closed.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - risk_management
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Lack of documented response plans prolongs harmful behavior and undermines
    regulatory reporting.
