part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Final evaluation split reserved for measuring real-world performance after
  all model tuning is finished.
long_def: The test set acts as the last line of defense before deployment. Once training
  and validation are complete, teams use this untouched data slice to estimate how
  a model will behave in production. Because it reflects realistic scenarios and has
  never influenced tuning decisions, the test set provides credible evidence for governance
  reviews, model cards, and launch approvals. Product owners study test outcomes to
  understand business impact, while engineers compare historical test set runs to
  spot regressions or drift. Strict separation from training and validation data,
  coupled with version control and documented refresh policies, preserves trust in
  test results.
audiences:
  exec: The test set is our final validation that the model keeps its promises before
    customers see it.
  engineer: Protect the test set from reuse, track baseline metrics over time, and
    rotate it only with formal approvals.
examples:
  do:
  - Store multiple generations of test sets so you can benchmark new models against
    historical baselines.
  - Capture subgroup metrics and qualitative notes during every test run for audit
    trails.
  dont:
  - Peek at the test set to choose hyperparameters or feature engineering steps.
  - Reuse the same test set indefinitely without monitoring for stale scenarios.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Compromised test sets hide regressions and undercut the evidence required
    for responsible AI approvals.
