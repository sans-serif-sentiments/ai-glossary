part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Quantitative measures that evaluate whether model performance is equitable
  across groups.
long_def: Fairness metrics quantify disparities between demographic or contextual
  groups. Common measures include demographic parity, equalized odds, equal opportunity,
  predictive parity, and subgroup-specific precision/recall. Teams apply these metrics
  during model evaluation, post-deployment monitoring, and incident response to detect
  fairness regressions. Choosing the right metric depends on regulatory requirements
  and domain priorities; not all metrics can be optimized simultaneously. Policy and
  legal stakeholders define fairness thresholds, while engineers build pipelines that
  compute metrics for each release and in production dashboards. Findings feed into
  model cards, governance reviews, and mitigation plans.
audiences:
  exec: Fairness metrics tell us whether different groups get comparable outcomes
    from the AI.
  engineer: Compute metrics such as equalized odds, statistical parity difference,
    or subgroup ROC; monitor trends across releases and production.
examples:
  do:
  - Align fairness thresholds with business and regulatory requirements.
  - Track fairness metrics alongside traditional accuracy metrics in CI/CD.
  dont:
  - Rely on a single fairness metric without understanding trade-offs.
  - Evaluate overall fairness without subgroup data or feedback from impacted communities.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - fairness
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Failure to monitor fairness metrics can lead to discrimination, legal
    liability, and loss of trust.
