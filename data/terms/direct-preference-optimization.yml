long_def: >-
  Direct preference optimization (DPO) replaces the reward-model-and-RL step in traditional RLHF with a closed-form
  objective that pushes the model toward preferred responses. Using paired comparisons, it optimizes log-likelihood ratios
  so preferred outputs receive higher probability while disfavored ones decrease. DPO simplifies infrastructure and
  reduces instability caused by reinforcement learning. Engineers still need high-quality preference datasets and
  evaluation benchmarks, while policy teams confirm that annotator guidance reflects safety requirements. Poor datasets or
  hyperparameter choices can lead to overfitting, regressions, or policy drift, so monitoring remains critical.
audiences:
  exec: "DPO lowers alignment overhead but still requires tight governance on data quality and evaluations."
  engineer: "Track win rates and safety metrics before and after DPO to ensure improvements hold."
examples:
  do:
    - "Re-run safety and quality benchmarks after each optimization pass."
    - "Blend DPO with instruction tuning refreshes to keep behavior current."
  dont:
    - "Assume DPO eliminates the need for human review or reward analyses."
    - "Train on preference data without validating annotator consistency."
