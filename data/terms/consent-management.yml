short_def: Practices that capture, honor, and audit user permissions across AI features.
long_def: Consent management ensures AI systems only process data in ways users or
  data subjects have authorized. It covers how organizations collect consent, represent
  it in data pipelines, respect withdrawal requests, and surface disclosures in product
  experiences. Legal and policy teams define the consent taxonomy, product teams design
  user flows, and engineers propagate consent flags through storage, training, and
  inference systems. Mature programs monitor for drift and provide regulators with
  evidence that consent was honored. Weak consent management risks privacy violations,
  regulatory fines, and erosion of customer trust.
audiences:
  exec: Treat consent as an auditable control so expansion plans avoid regulatory
    setbacks.
  engineer: Propagate consent metadata end-to-end and block models from accessing
    disallowed data.
examples:
  do:
  - Record granular consent states and expiration dates for every data subject.
  - Automate purge workflows when users revoke consent.
  dont:
  - Bundle broad AI permissions into generic terms-of-service text without explicit
    choice.
  - Retrofit consent flags after data has already trained foundational models.
