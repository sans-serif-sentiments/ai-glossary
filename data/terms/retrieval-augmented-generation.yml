short_def: Workflow that grounds a generative model with retrieved context before
  producing output.
long_def: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines information retrieval and
  text generation so that a model answers questions using relevant, up-to-date context
  instead of only relying on patterns memorized during pretraining. A retrieval component
  first decomposes the user query and searches a corpus—via sparse, dense, or hybrid
  methods—to surface the most relevant passages. Those passages are then packaged,
  often alongside metadata like source citations, and injected into the model prompt
  or context window prior to decoding. The approach reduces hallucinations, improves
  factual accuracy, and enables small models to compete with larger ones when grounded
  knowledge is more important than general fluency. Successful RAG systems invest
  in document chunking, embedding quality, reranking, and evaluation pipelines that
  monitor both retrieval recall and answer precision. Governance teams value RAG because
  it enables transparent sourcing and can encode organizational policies in the retrieval
  layer, but they also monitor for drift, stale content, and privacy leaks when sensitive
  documents are indexed.
audiences:
  exec: 'Treat it as a guardrail: the system fetches trusted documents before the
    model speaks, so answers stay on-policy.'
  engineer: Pipeline = query rewriting, retriever (BM25, DPR, hybrid), reranker, and
    generator with retrieved context appended to the prompt.
examples:
  do:
  - Version and monitor the document index so you can trace outputs back to specific
    sources.
  - Evaluate retrieval recall and answer accuracy separately to isolate failure modes.
  dont:
  - Assume RAG removes the need for model fine-tuning or ongoing evaluation.
  - Index sensitive records without access controls or data minimization.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - data_quality
  - documentation
  risk_notes: Requires controls for stale data, source governance, and privacy when
    indexing internal corpora.
