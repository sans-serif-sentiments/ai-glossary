short_def: Controller layer that schedules planning, tool calls, and stop conditions
  so an AI agent completes tasks safely.
long_def: An agent executor is the control loop that wraps a language model with planning,
  tool routing, memory updates, and termination rules. It interprets the model's action
  plans, selects the right tool or retriever, enforces guardrails, and decides when
  the task is complete or needs human escalation. Mature executors persist interim
  state, log each decision for observability, and cap iteration budgets to avoid runaway
  loops. Product teams set policies for the executor about tool eligibility or human
  approval, while engineers own the orchestration logic that keeps the agent explainable
  and reversible. Without a disciplined executor, agent architectures tend to overrun
  budgets, trigger risky actions, or hide provenance needed for governance reviews.
audiences:
  exec: Clarify what control layer governs autonomous workflows so you can scope approvals
    and accountability.
  engineer: 'Treat the executor as orchestrator code: build deterministic plans, enforce
    stop criteria, and log every action.'
examples:
  do:
  - Cap the number of tool invocations per task and emit structured traces for monitoring.
  - Define escalation triggers that halt the loop when confidence drops or policies
    flag sensitive data.
  dont:
  - Let the agent call privileged tools without a permissions check in the executor.
  - Ship an executor without human-readable logs or telemetry for audit reviews.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - governance
  - risk_management
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Unbounded loops or opaque routing decisions can create safety, compliance,
    and cost exposures.
