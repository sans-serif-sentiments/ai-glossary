part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Table that summarizes true/false positives and negatives to diagnose classification
  performance.
long_def: A confusion matrix breaks down classification results into true positives,
  true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Visualizing performance in
  this way helps teams understand error patterns, detect class imbalance issues, and
  compute derived metrics such as precision, recall, specificity, and accuracy. Product
  managers use confusion matrices to explain trade-offs to stakeholders, while engineers
  leverage them to tune thresholds, resampling strategies, or loss functions. Policy
  and compliance reviewers rely on confusion matrix evidence to confirm that sensitive
  cohorts are not disproportionately affected. Confusion matrices are most informative
  when compared across slices—by time, geography, or demographic attributes—to catch
  drift and fairness concerns.
audiences:
  exec: A confusion matrix shows where the AI is right or wrong so you can see which
    mistakes matter most.
  engineer: Tabulate TP, TN, FP, FN counts; analyze row/column distributions and normalize
    per class to diagnose bias and guide mitigation.
examples:
  do:
  - Normalize confusion matrices to compare error rates across classes of different
    sizes.
  - Track confusion matrices over time to spot drift and guardrail regressions.
  dont:
  - Rely on aggregate accuracy without inspecting confusion patterns.
  - Hide confusion matrices from stakeholders—they clarify trade-offs.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - validity
  risk_notes: Ignoring confusion matrix signals can allow harmful error patterns to
    persist unnoticed.
