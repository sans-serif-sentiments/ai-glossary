short_def: Central list of identified AI risks, their owners, mitigations, and review
  status.
long_def: A risk register tracks every material risk an AI system poses, including
  potential harms, likelihood, impact, and planned mitigations. It links each item
  to an accountable owner, current status, and evidence such as evaluation results
  or assurance case references. Policy teams maintain the register for governance
  reviews, product owners prioritize fixes, engineering updates mitigation progress,
  and legal teams map entries to regulatory obligations. The register should be version-controlled
  and reviewed regularly; letting it go stale leaves leadership blind to emerging
  exposures.
audiences:
  exec: Use the risk register as a single source of truth when approving launches
    or investments.
  engineer: Update mitigation status promptly so policy partners can judge readiness
    accurately.
