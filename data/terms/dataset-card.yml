short_def: Structured documentation describing a dataset’s purpose, composition, risks,
  and usage constraints.
long_def: A dataset card records how and why data was collected, what populations
  it represents, known biases, licensing, and recommended uses. Inspired by model
  cards and “datasheets for datasets,” the card gives reviewers the context needed
  to judge fitness for training or evaluation. Data scientists author technical details,
  policy and legal teams capture risk considerations, and product teams reference
  the card when scoping features. Keeping cards up to date enables auditors to trace
  claims back to source data and supports transparency commitments.
audiences:
  exec: Require dataset cards before approving new training data to avoid surprises
    later.
  engineer: Link data pipelines and model training jobs back to the referenced card
    for traceability.
