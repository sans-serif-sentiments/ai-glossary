short_def: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning that injects low-rank update matrices into
  transformer weights.
long_def: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tunes large language models by learning
  compact update matrices rather than adjusting full weight tensors. The method freezes
  the original model parameters and trains additive low-rank factors that capture
  task-specific shifts, reducing memory usage and compute costs. LoRA adapters can
  be merged into the base model for deployment or stored separately to toggle behaviors
  per tenant. This approach enables organizations to customize models using modest
  hardware, accelerate experimentation, and share adapters without distributing full
  proprietary checkpoints. Engineers manage rank choices, scaling factors, and target
  layers to balance quality with efficiency. Governance teams evaluate LoRA artifacts
  like traditional model versions, reviewing data provenance, licensing, and security
  implications. Because adapters can encode sensitive capabilities, access control
  and documentation remain essential—particularly when multiple teams contribute adapters
  to a shared serving stack.
audiences:
  exec: LoRA lets teams customize giant models cheaply by training small plug-ins
    instead of retraining everything.
  engineer: Freeze base weights, insert trainable low-rank matrices into attention
    or feed-forward layers, and fine-tune with minimal VRAM.
examples:
  do:
  - Track which datasets and objectives produced each LoRA adapter before sharing
    it across teams.
  dont:
  - Merge third-party adapters into production models without license verification.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - efficiency
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Unvetted adapters can override safety tuning or introduce licensed data
    without traceability.
