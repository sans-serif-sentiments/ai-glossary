part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Model's ability to sustain performance on unseen data rather than memorising
  the training set.
long_def: 'Generalization determines whether a model delivers value once it leaves
  the lab. A system that overfits will look strong on training data but collapse when
  it meets new markets, languages, or customer behaviours. Engineering teams manage
  generalization by pairing representative train/validation/test splits with regularization,
  augmentation, and drift monitoring. Product and policy partners translate generalization
  risk into business and compliance exposure: degraded accuracy erodes customer trust,
  introduces bias, and can violate contractual or regulatory commitments. Healthy
  generalization comes from both technical controls and operational hygiene: clear
  loss functions, reproducible experiments, and post-deployment telemetry that surfaces
  when reality shifts away from the training distribution.'
audiences:
  exec: Generalization shows whether the model keeps its promises once it meets real
    customers and scenarios.
  engineer: Track performance on held-out and in-production slices, tune regularization,
    and trigger retraining when drift appears.
examples:
  do:
  - Hold back a realistic test set and monitor post-launch telemetry to confirm generalization.
  - Log distribution shifts and retrain when key features move away from training
    baselines.
  dont:
  - Ship models based solely on training metrics or synthetic benchmarks.
  - Ignore subgroup breakdowns that reveal poor generalization for protected or high-value
    cohorts.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - robustness
  risk_notes: Poor generalization is a leading indicator of bias, drift, and safety
    incidents, so governance reviews demand evidence of monitoring.
