part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Artificially generated dataset used to augment training, testing, or privacy-preserving
  workflows.
long_def: Synthetic data recreates statistical properties of real datasets without
  exposing exact records. Teams generate it with generative models, simulations, or
  rule-based scripts to augment scarce examples, balance demographic representation,
  or share data across boundaries. When used responsibly, synthetic data accelerates
  experimentation and protects privacy; when mismanaged, it can amplify biases, leak
  sensitive patterns, or give a false sense of security. Product and data science
  teams validate that synthetic datasets preserve signal relevant to their tasks,
  while policy and security partners evaluate whether the generation process meets
  governance requirements. Documentation should cover source data lineage, generation
  methods, and evaluation metrics such as fidelity, utility, and privacy leakage.
  Synthetic data is most effective when paired with differential privacy, guardrails,
  and robust monitoring that detects drift between simulated and real-world behavior.
audiences:
  exec: Synthetic data lets teams test and train quickly without always touching sensitive
    customer records.
  engineer: Generate data via simulations or generative models; validate fidelity,
    diversity, and privacy leakage before using it in pipelines.
examples:
  do:
  - Track utility metrics comparing model performance on synthetic versus real validation
    sets.
  - Label synthetic datasets clearly so downstream teams understand provenance.
  dont:
  - Assume synthetic data automatically removes bias—measure subgroup impacts explicitly.
  - Share synthetic datasets externally without privacy and legal review.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - privacy
  - data_quality
  risk_notes: Poorly generated data can encode discriminatory patterns or expose sensitive
    distributions; pair releases with privacy and bias assessments.
