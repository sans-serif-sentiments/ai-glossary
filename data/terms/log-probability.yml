short_def: Logarithm of a token’s probability, used to inspect model confidence and
  guide decoding tweaks.
long_def: Log probability represents the natural logarithm of a token’s predicted
  probability during generation. Because probabilities multiply across sequence lengths,
  working in log space avoids numerical underflow and makes it easier to compare relative
  likelihoods. Tooling that surfaces token-level logprobs helps practitioners debug
  why a model chose specific words, identify low-confidence spans for post-processing,
  and implement rejection sampling. Product teams use logprob thresholds to trigger
  fallbacks, escalate to humans, or annotate responses with confidence indicators.
  Engineers rely on logprobs to enforce constraints such as toxicity caps, apply repetition
  penalties, or calibrate beam search scores. Governance stakeholders treat logprob
  telemetry as part of audit trails, correlating low-confidence regions with incidents
  or hallucinations. Capturing and analyzing log probabilities thus supports transparency
  requirements and informs mitigation strategies when behavior drifts over time.
audiences:
  exec: Log probabilities surface how confident the model was about each word, which
    can trigger reviews when confidence drops.
  engineer: Natural-log scores from the softmax output that accumulate across tokens;
    useful for diagnostics, penalties, and rejection sampling.
examples:
  do:
  - Flag completions where average logprob falls below a threshold and route them
    for human review.
  dont:
  - Expose raw logprob values to end users without context or calibration.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - validity
  risk_notes: Missing logprob telemetry makes it harder to audit why unsafe or incorrect
    outputs were produced.
