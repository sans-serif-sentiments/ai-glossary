part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Operational discipline that manages ML models from experimentation through
  deployment and monitoring.
long_def: ML Ops adapts DevOps and data engineering practices to the lifecycle of
  machine learning systems. It encompasses experiment tracking, feature management,
  deployment automation, monitoring, incident response, and governance. Successful
  ML Ops programs unify teams across data science, engineering, and compliance so
  models move from prototype to production without manual heroics. Tooling includes
  model registries, CI/CD pipelines, automated evaluation gates, and observability
  platforms that watch for drift, data quality issues, and guardrail violations. Product
  organizations rely on ML Ops maturity to ship updates safely and respond quickly
  to incidents. Governance frameworks such as the NIST AI RMF expect documented ML
  Ops processes to demonstrate accountability, transparency, and continuous monitoring.
  Without disciplined ML Ops, models stagnate, degrade in accuracy, or fall out of
  compliance as the environment evolves.
audiences:
  exec: ML Ops is the operating system that keeps production models reliable, compliant,
    and cost-efficient.
  engineer: Integrate version control, CI/CD, registries, approvals, and monitoring
    to manage ML artifacts end to end.
examples:
  do:
  - Automate promotion from staging to production only after evaluation and guardrail
    checks pass.
  dont:
  - Deploy model updates outside the pipeline, bypassing logging and rollback controls.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - monitoring
  risk_notes: Weak ML Ops processes increase the odds of untracked changes, bias reintroductions,
    and compliance failures.
