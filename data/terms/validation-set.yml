part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Dataset slice used to tune hyperparameters and compare experiments without
  touching the test set.
long_def: The validation set provides an unbiased checkpoint during model development.
  After fitting on the training data, teams gauge performance on this held-out split
  to choose architectures, hyperparameters, and stopping criteria. A disciplined validation
  strategy prevents information leakage into the final test set, offering a realistic
  signal of how design choices will play out in production. Product leaders rely on
  validation metrics to weigh accuracy against latency or cost trade-offs, while engineers
  track subgroup results to guard against bias. Clear documentation of validation
  protocol, refresh cadence, and governance sign-off keeps experiment logs reproducible
  and audit ready.
audiences:
  exec: Validation data is the dress rehearsal that tells us if the model is ready
    before the final exam.
  engineer: Keep validation slices immutable, monitor for drift, and reset them when
    feature space or labeling rules change.
examples:
  do:
  - Log every hyperparameter trial that reads the validation set to maintain experiment
    lineage.
  - Audit validation performance across protected cohorts before promoting a model.
  dont:
  - Tune against the test set or stack multiple validations from overlapping data.
  - Treat validation metrics as final sign-off without human review or business context.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - robustness
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Mismanaged validation data masks overfitting and governance gaps, leading
    to unexpected failures after launch.
