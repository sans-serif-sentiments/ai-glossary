short_def: Maximum number of tokens a model can consider at once during prompting
  or inference.
long_def: The context window defines how many tokens a model can ingest in a single
  forward pass, combining both prompt input and generated output. Because transformer
  attention scales quadratically with sequence length, vendors ship models with fixed
  limits that balance cost, latency, and accuracy. Exceeding the window forces truncation
  or sliding-window strategies that can drop critical instructions. Product teams
  map context size to user scenarios—for example, how long a document can be summarized
  or how many chat messages remain in memory. Engineers manage context budgets through
  prompt compression, retrieval chunking, and caching mechanisms like recurrent attention
  or stateful decoding. Governance stakeholders examine context policies to ensure
  sensitive data is not unintentionally persisted across conversations or logged beyond
  retention periods, especially when long windows capture personally identifiable
  information.
audiences:
  exec: A context window is the attention span of the model—go past it and instructions
    fall off.
  engineer: Token budget for input plus output per request; drives attention memory
    use and dictates truncation strategies.
examples:
  do:
  - Document context requirements by user journey so prompts stay within safe token
    limits.
  dont:
  - Assume extending the context window eliminates the need for retrieval or prompt
    optimization.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - privacy
  risk_notes: Oversized contexts can capture unnecessary personal data and complicate
    retention or deletion obligations.
