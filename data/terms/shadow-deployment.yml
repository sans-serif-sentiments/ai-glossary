short_def: "Deploying an AI system alongside the existing workflow without user impact to collect telemetry."
long_def: >-
  In a shadow deployment, an AI model runs in production but its outputs are not shown to end users or do not control the
  primary workflow. Teams compare shadow results against human decisions, measure safety metrics, and stress-test guardrails
  before full launch. Engineering sets up parallel pipelines, product owners define success criteria, and policy leaders
  review logs for compliance or bias. Shadow mode provides real-world data without exposing customers to unverified
  behavior, but only if teams actively review the telemetry and follow up on issues.
audiences:
  exec: "Use shadow deployments to de-risk launches and inform go/no-go decisions with real data."
  engineer: "Instrument drift, safety, and latency metrics during shadow mode and share findings broadly."
examples:
  do:
    - "Run shadow mode until evaluation thresholds and mitigation backlog items are cleared."
    - "Log disagreements between the AI and human decisions for analysis."
  dont:
    - "Let shadow deployments run without active monitoring or ownership."
    - "Ignore privacy commitments when storing shadow outputs."
