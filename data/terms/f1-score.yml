part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, balancing false positives and false
  negatives.
long_def: The F1 score combines precision and recall into a single metric by calculating
  their harmonic mean. It is especially useful when positive class distribution is
  imbalanced and teams need a balanced view of false positives and false negatives.
  An F1 score close to 1.0 indicates strong performance on both metrics, while low
  values signal trade-offs that require attention. Product managers use F1 to compare
  model variants quickly, and engineers track the score across cohorts to detect regressions
  after retraining or threshold changes. Because F1 weights precision and recall equally,
  decision-makers should confirm that assumption matches business priorities; otherwise
  metrics like F-beta or cost-based evaluation may be more appropriate.
audiences:
  exec: F1 score summarizes how well the AI avoids both false alarms and missed detections.
  engineer: 2 * (precision * recall) / (precision + recall); monitor per-class F1
    and consider F-beta when recall or precision matters more.
examples:
  do:
  - Report F1 alongside precision, recall, and confusion matrices for context.
  - Track F1 trends after model updates to catch regressions early.
  dont:
  - Rely on F1 when business costs heavily favor precision or recall.
  - Compare F1 across datasets without consistent class distributions.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Misinterpreting F1 can hide risk trade-offs; document why the weight
    between precision and recall fits the use case.
