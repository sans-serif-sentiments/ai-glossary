part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Policies and processes that manage AI models across risk, compliance, and
  lifecycle decisions.
long_def: Model governance coordinates legal, risk, engineering, and product roles
  to oversee how AI systems are developed, deployed, and maintained. Core activities
  include documenting intended use, validating data sources, approving releases, monitoring
  for drift, and managing incidents. Governance frameworks—such as the NIST AI RMF
  or ISO/IEC standards—expect organizations to maintain traceability for models, prompts,
  datasets, and evaluation evidence. Committees or designated owners review changes,
  enforce segregation of duties, and ensure audits can reconstruct decisions. Product
  teams rely on governance guardrails to align with policy, while engineers integrate
  governance checkpoints into ML Ops pipelines. Without governance, AI initiatives
  accumulate technical debt, expose companies to regulatory penalties, and erode user
  trust. Mature governance balances innovation with accountability, enabling responsible
  scaling of AI capabilities.
audiences:
  exec: Model governance keeps AI programs aligned with policy, compliance, and stakeholder
    expectations as they scale.
  engineer: Define ownership, documentation, approvals, and monitoring requirements
    so every model change is auditable.
examples:
  do:
  - Record decision logs and reviewers for each production model release.
  dont:
  - Deploy models without documenting purpose, controls, and evaluation results.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - risk_management
  risk_notes: Absent governance leads to untracked risks, inconsistent controls, and
    regulatory exposure.
