part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Gradual mismatch between model assumptions and real-world data that degrades
  performance over time.
long_def: 'Model drift arises when the data encountered in production no longer matches
  the distribution seen during training or evaluation. Changes in user behavior, regulations,
  adversarial inputs, or upstream systems can all erode accuracy and trustworthiness.
  Drift appears in multiple forms: data drift alters input characteristics, concept
  drift changes the meaning of target labels, and prior drift moves latent relationships
  within embeddings. Operations teams monitor dashboards for early signals using statistical
  tests, canary evaluations, and feedback loops. Product managers plan remediation
  playbooks that include prompt updates, retrieval refreshes, or new fine-tuning cycles.
  Governance frameworks require drift detection as part of continuous monitoring obligations,
  ensuring sensitive use cases receive timely reviews. Documenting drift incidents,
  response timelines, and residual risk assessments supports compliance and informs
  future model lifecycle decisions.'
audiences:
  exec: Model drift is the slow decay that happens when the world changes but the
    AI stays static.
  engineer: Shift between training and production distributions; measured via statistical
    monitoring and addressed with retraining or prompt updates.
examples:
  do:
  - Set drift thresholds and automated alerts tied to evaluation reruns for critical
    workflows.
  dont:
  - Ignore user feedback that signals degraded relevance or bias until after incidents
    occur.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - monitoring
  - validity
  risk_notes: Undetected drift can lead to policy violations, misaligned outputs,
    and regulatory non-compliance.
