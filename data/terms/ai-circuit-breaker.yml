short_def: Automated control that halts model responses or tool access when risk thresholds
  are exceeded.
long_def: An AI circuit breaker detects abnormal behavior—such as rapid policy violations,
  runaway tool use, or anomalous telemetry—and stops the system from continuing without
  human approval. It can disable outputs, revoke tool permissions, or route all traffic
  to human agents. Security and engineering teams design detection logic, policy leaders
  set thresholds, and product teams coordinate user messaging. Circuit breakers complement
  escalation policies and incident response plans, providing a fast path to contain
  harm. Without them, incidents may escalate faster than humans can intervene manually.
audiences:
  exec: Mandate circuit breakers for high-impact automations to cap worst-case scenarios.
  engineer: Log activations, reasons, and resolution notes so the control remains
    auditable.
examples:
  do:
  - Trigger a breaker if safety classifiers flag repeated violations within a session.
  - Simulate breaker events during chaos exercises to ensure recovery paths work.
  dont:
  - Leave breaker logic undocumented or dependent on a single engineer.
  - Ignore alerts after a breaker fires; reset only after root cause analysis.

  risk_notes: Without emergency stops, AI incidents can cause cascading harm before
    humans respond.
