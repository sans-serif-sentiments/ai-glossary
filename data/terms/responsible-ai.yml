short_def: Frameworks and practices that ensure AI systems are safe, fair, and aligned
  with ethical and legal expectations.
long_def: Responsible AI encompasses the policies, technical controls, and cultural
  norms that guide how AI is built and deployed. It integrates principles such as
  fairness, transparency, accountability, privacy, and security into each phase of
  the model lifecycle. Organizations operationalize responsible AI through governance
  committees, risk assessments, red teaming, documentation standards, and inclusive
  design processes. Engineering teams implement safeguards like guardrails, evaluation
  suites, and monitoring to enforce these principles. Product and legal leaders translate
  regulatory requirements and stakeholder expectations into practical guardrails and
  disclosures. Responsible AI is not a single project but an ongoing discipline that
  adapts as technology and regulations evolve. By grounding innovations in responsible
  AI, organizations increase user trust, reduce liability, and create sustainable
  value.
