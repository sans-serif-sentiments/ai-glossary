short_def: Model trained on human preferences that scores AI responses for alignment
  or quality.
long_def: A reward model predicts how well a generated response aligns with human
  preferences or policy guidelines. Teams train it on comparison data where annotators
  choose the better of two or more outputs. The reward model then guides reinforcement
  learning, ranking, or rejection sampling to steer the underlying AI system. Because
  it encodes policy judgments, the model must be audited for bias, saturation, and
  overfitting. Engineers monitor reward drift, policy teams review labeling instructions,
  and data scientists retrain the model as new behaviors emerge. If the reward model
  is misaligned or gamed, the downstream system can optimize for the wrong incentives.
audiences:
  exec: Treat reward models as governance artifacts—they translate policy into scalable
    automation.
  engineer: Version datasets, metrics, and calibration checks so the reward model
    stays trustworthy.
examples:
  do:
  - Validate reward scores against a holdout of human-reviewed examples.
  - Document known blind spots and include them in launch gates.
  dont:
  - Deploy reward models without monitoring for reward hacking.
  - Train on unverified or biased annotations.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - measurement
  - risk_management
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Reward models encode subjective policy choices; poor oversight leads
    to misaligned optimization.
