part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Outcome the model is trained to predict, providing the signal for calculating
  loss.
long_def: The target variable is the reference output used to evaluate model predictions
  during training and testing. In supervised learning it represents ground truth labels,
  such as fraud or not fraud, estimated price, or safety category. Accurate, consistent
  targets allow teams to compute loss functions, track metrics like precision and
  recall, and align models with business objectives. Product stakeholders define which
  real-world outcome matters most, while engineers and data scientists maintain labeling
  pipelines, quality checks, and access controls. Poorly governed targets undermine
  evaluation integrity and can encode bias, leading to misinformed decisions at launch.
audiences:
  exec: The target variable is the result we ask the model to get right so business
    decisions stay grounded.
  engineer: Keep labeling guidelines versioned, audit quality, and map targets to
    downstream KPIs before training.
examples:
  do:
  - Review labeling consistency across vendors before starting a new training run.
  - Document how targets map to customer outcomes in the model card.
  dont:
  - Mix labels from incompatible taxonomies without reconciliation.
  - Expose sensitive targets to broad teams without privacy controls.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - fairness
  risk_notes: Low-quality target variables hide discrimination, inflate metrics, and
    break compliance attestations.
