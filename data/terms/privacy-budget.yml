part_of_speech: noun_phrase
short_def: Quantitative limit on how much privacy loss is allowed when applying differential
  privacy.
long_def: A privacy budget sets the maximum cumulative privacy loss (often parameterized
  by epsilon) that an organization will tolerate when querying or training with differentially
  private mechanisms. Each query or training run consumes part of the budget, so teams
  must track usage and halt processing when the limit is reached. Policy and legal
  leaders define acceptable thresholds, data scientists monitor consumption, and engineers
  enforce the budget in pipelines. Without budget tracking, repeated queries can quietly
  degrade privacy guarantees beyond regulatory or ethical bounds.
audiences:
  exec: Treat the privacy budget as a compliance control that requires monitoring
    and governance.
  engineer: Instrument analytics and training jobs to decrement the budget automatically
    and alert owners.
examples:
  do:
  - Document initial and remaining epsilon values alongside each release.
  - Aggregate similar queries to conserve budget and reduce risk.
  dont:
  - Ignore budget depletion warnings for critical user data.
  - Share raw event logs when the privacy budget reaches zero.

  risk_notes: Overrunning the budget invalidates differential privacy claims and increases
    legal exposure.
