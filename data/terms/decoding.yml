short_def: Algorithms that turn model probability distributions into output tokens
  during generation.
long_def: Decoding encompasses the strategies used to convert a model’s token probabilities
  into concrete outputs. Common methods include greedy decoding, beam search, top-k
  sampling, and nucleus (top-p) sampling, each trading off determinism, diversity,
  latency, and risk. Selection of a decoding algorithm affects user experience, safety
  posture, and evaluation results far more than many teams realize. Product managers
  configure decoding policies by use case—for example, deterministic responses for
  support scenarios and higher-variance sampling for ideation tools. Engineers implement
  controls such as temperature scaling, repetition penalties, and logprob thresholds
  to manage failure modes like hallucinations or loops. Governance programs capture
  decoding settings in change logs because updates can materially alter risk assessments.
  Understanding decoding is foundational to building reliable guardrails, interpreting
  evaluation results, and communicating the behavior of generative systems to stakeholders.
audiences:
  exec: Decoding is the decision logic that turns the model’s probabilities into the
    words customers see.
  engineer: Apply algorithms like greedy, top-k, or top-p to sample from the softmax
    distribution while enforcing constraints and penalties.
examples:
  do:
  - Document decoding parameters alongside each release note for regulated experiences.
  dont:
  - Mix decoding strategies across channels without coordinating evaluation coverage.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - robustness
  risk_notes: Untracked decoding changes can invalidate safety testing and confuse
    incident investigations.
