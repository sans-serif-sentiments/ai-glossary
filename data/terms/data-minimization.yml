part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Principle of collecting and retaining only the data necessary for a defined
  purpose.
long_def: Data minimization limits the amount and duration of personal data collected,
  processed, or stored. Regulations such as GDPR and CCPA mandate this principle so
  organizations cannot hoard information “just in case.” In AI projects, minimization
  applies to training datasets, prompt logs, telemetry, and derived embeddings. Product
  teams collaborate with legal and security to define clear purposes, expiration timelines,
  and deletion workflows. Engineers implement technical controls such as field-level
  encryption, redaction, and retention policies. Adoption of data minimization reduces
  breach impact, compliance risk, and model bias stemming from unnecessary sensitive
  attributes. Documenting minimization choices is also a prerequisite for privacy
  impact assessments and external audits.
audiences:
  exec: Data minimization keeps us from collecting more personal information than
    we need, reducing risk.
  engineer: Implement least-data pipelines, redact sensitive fields, and enforce retention
    limits that map to documented business purposes.
examples:
  do:
  - Align prompts and telemetry retention with published privacy notices.
  - Automate deletion of training data that no longer supports the model’s purpose.
  dont:
  - Copy entire databases into model pipelines without reviewing necessity.
  - Keep user data after opt-outs or contract end dates.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - privacy
  - risk_management
  risk_notes: Excess data increases breach exposure, drives regulatory penalties,
    and can introduce bias into models.
