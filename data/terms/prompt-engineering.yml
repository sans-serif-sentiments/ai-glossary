part_of_speech: process
short_def: Crafting and testing prompts to steer model behavior toward desired outcomes.
long_def: Prompt engineering involves designing the instructions, examples, and context
  provided to a language model so it produces reliable, policy-compliant responses.
  Practitioners experiment with phrasing, ordering, few-shot examples, and formatting
  cues to influence reasoning steps or output structure. The discipline has evolved
  from ad-hoc experimentation to a structured workflow that includes prompt libraries,
  evaluation harnesses, and version control. Prompt engineers collaborate with product,
  legal, and safety teams to encode business rules, tone, and disallowed behaviors,
  often in tandem with system prompts and guardrails. They also balance token budgets
  against performance, ensuring prompts fit within context windows while still providing
  the necessary guidance. Governance functions expect prompt changes to pass through
  review queues, since a seemingly small tweak can alter safety posture or introduce
  bias.
audiences:
  exec: Prompt engineering is how we teach the model to act like our product or policy
    experts.
  engineer: Systematic design of prompt structure, exemplars, and metadata; evaluated
    via regression suites to manage behavior drift.
examples:
  do:
  - Version prompts and run automated evals before rolling them out to production
    flows.
  dont:
  - Copy prompts between domains without revisiting legal and safety requirements.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - accountability
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Unreviewed prompt changes can bypass controls and result in unsafe or
    misleading outputs.
