short_def: Documented rules and prompts that define allowed, blocked, and escalated
  behaviors for AI systems.
long_def: A guardrail policy spells out how an AI system should respond to risky scenarios,
  combining policy prompts, tool restrictions, monitoring hooks, and escalation paths.
  It anchors the guardrails implemented in code to clear governance expectations so
  product, safety, and engineering teams act in sync. The policy enumerates prohibited
  content, required disclosures, human handoff triggers, and review cadences, and
  maps each rule to enforcement controls in the stack. Security leaders reference
  it when auditing access, while product owners ensure the policy keeps user experience
  coherent. Without this shared artifact, teams risk shipping fragmented mitigations
  that fail investigative audits or leave gaps between policy intent and agent behavior.
audiences:
  exec: Use the guardrail policy to prove you have enforceable boundaries before scaling
    sensitive features.
  engineer: Translate each rule into prompts, filters, and monitoring alerts so violations
    are caught automatically.
examples:
  do:
  - Version-control policy prompts alongside code so deployments document why changes
    were made.
  - Define human approval checkpoints for financial or legal actions triggered by
    the agent.
  dont:
  - Rely on ad-hoc prompt tweaks without peer review or governance sign-off.
  - Ship new tools without mapping them to prohibited-use clauses in the policy.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - governance
  - risk_management
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Missing or outdated guardrail policies make it impossible to demonstrate
    control effectiveness during audits.
