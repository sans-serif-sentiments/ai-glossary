short_def: Step that refines retrieval results using a more precise but slower scoring
  model.
long_def: Reranking applies a secondary model to an initial set of retrieved documents
  to reorder them according to task-specific relevance. The first retrieval pass prioritizes
  speed, often using sparse or dense similarity search to gather dozens of candidates.
  A reranker—frequently a cross-encoder or lightweight generative model—then evaluates
  each candidate alongside the query to produce fine-grained scores. This approach
  improves precision, supports citation quality in RAG, and helps guardrails by pushing
  irrelevant or risky passages down the list. Engineers tune rerankers by limiting
  candidate set sizes, caching scores, and measuring latency budgets. Governance considerations
  include documenting model provenance, ensuring the reranker does not encode discriminatory
  bias, and verifying that safety filters still apply after reordering. When reranking
  is well managed, it improves both factual accuracy and user trust without incurring
  the cost of fully generative evaluation for every document in the corpus.
audiences:
  exec: Reranking lets us double-check the top answers so users see the most reliable
    sources first.
  engineer: Second-stage scorer—often a cross-encoder—reorders retrieved candidates
    to boost precision while respecting latency limits.
examples:
  do:
  - Measure precision@k with and without reranking to justify added latency.
  dont:
  - Deploy rerankers trained on outdated data without monitoring for regressions in
    safety filters.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - validity
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Biased rerankers can systematically down-rank protected viewpoints or
    surface outdated information.
