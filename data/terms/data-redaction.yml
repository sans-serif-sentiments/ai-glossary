part_of_speech: process
short_def: Removal or masking of sensitive fields before data is stored, shared, or
  used for model training.
long_def: Data redaction removes or obfuscates sensitive information—such as personal
  identifiers, secrets, or confidential business details—before data is logged, retrained,
  or surfaced to analysts. Techniques include masking, hashing, token substitution,
  and selective deletion. Policy and legal teams define what must be redacted, engineers
  implement automated pipelines, and security verifies effectiveness through sampling
  and audits. Mature programs document redaction effectiveness, expose dashboards
  to auditors, and tie results to incident response drills. Redaction protects privacy,
  reduces breach impact, and supports compliance with consent and retention requirements.
  Incomplete redaction can leak sensitive information into training data or logs.
audiences:
  exec: Require automated redaction in telemetry and training pipelines to reduce
    regulatory exposure.
  engineer: Build redaction into ingestion pipelines and confirm outputs with monitoring.
examples:
  do:
  - Redact PII at the edge before persisting chat transcripts.
  - Track redaction effectiveness with periodic manual reviews.
  dont:
  - Rely solely on manual processes to strip sensitive data.
  - Redact without documenting which fields are affected, confusing downstream users.
