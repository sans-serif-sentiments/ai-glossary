short_def: Traceable record of how data moves, transforms, and is used across AI systems.
long_def: Data lineage maps the lifecycle of data from ingestion through processing,
  training, evaluation, and deployment. It records sources, transformations, storage
  locations, and downstream consumers so teams can audit usage, troubleshoot quality
  issues, and respond to regulatory requests. Engineering automates lineage capture
  in pipelines, data scientists log transformations in notebooks, and policy teams
  use lineage to verify compliance with consent and retention rules. Effective lineage
  feeds governance dashboards, reminds owners to retire obsolete datasets, and documents
  which models rely on each asset. Without lineage, it is difficult to honor deletion
  requests, explain model behavior, or investigate incidents.
audiences:
  exec: Treat lineage as foundational infrastructure for audit readiness and trust.
  engineer: Instrument pipelines to emit lineage metadata and expose it via searchable
    catalogs.
examples:
  do:
  - Link training datasets to their upstream sources and associated dataset cards.
  - Tag lineage records with retention and consent attributes.
  dont:
  - Rely on tribal knowledge to track where sensitive data flows.
  - Break lineage chains when copying data to ad hoc storage.
