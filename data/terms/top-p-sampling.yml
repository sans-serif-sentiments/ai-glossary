short_def: Decoding strategy that samples from the smallest set of tokens whose probabilities
  sum to p.
long_def: 'Top-p sampling, also called nucleus sampling, builds a dynamic shortlist
  of candidate tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds a threshold p. Instead
  of fixing the number of options, the method adapts to the shape of the probability
  distribution: sharply peaked distributions produce small candidate sets, while flatter
  distributions expand the pool. This flexibility makes top-p useful for preserving
  coherence in confident contexts while still allowing creative variations when the
  model is less certain. Engineers tune the p value in tandem with temperature to
  achieve the desired balance between determinism and variety. Product teams rely
  on the technique for experiences like storytelling, marketing copy, or brainstorming
  where monotone responses are undesirable. Governance teams record chosen p values
  alongside evaluation evidence, recognizing that higher thresholds can surface content
  not vetted during safety reviews. Monitoring how p interacts with policy classifiers
  and guardrails is an integral part of ongoing risk management.'
audiences:
  exec: A probability threshold that keeps responses varied without wandering too
    far off message.
  engineer: Accumulate token probabilities until they exceed p, normalize, then sample—yielding
    adaptive candidate sets per step.
examples:
  do:
  - Test critical workflows at p values of 0.7, 0.9, and 0.95 to document behavioral
    differences.
  dont:
  - Use high p thresholds for regulated communications without updated compliance
    sign-off.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - robustness
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Large nucleus thresholds can introduce unvetted behaviors and may invalidate
    safety testing baselines.
