part_of_speech: concept
short_def: Family of models that produce new content—text, images, code—rather than
  only making predictions.
long_def: Generative AI refers to systems that create novel outputs such as text,
  images, audio, or code by learning patterns from large training corpora. Foundation
  models like GPT, diffusion models, and multimodal architectures power these experiences
  by predicting the next token or pixel based on context. Organizations adopt generative
  AI for drafting, summarization, design, simulation, and synthetic data generation.
  The technology amplifies creativity and productivity but introduces unique risks,
  including hallucinations, intellectual property exposure, and safety concerns. Product
  leaders evaluate generative AI opportunities alongside guardrails, retrieval augmentation,
  and review workflows to keep outputs trustworthy. Engineers maintain the pipelines
  that tokenize data, manage prompts, deploy models, and monitor usage at scale. Governance
  teams coordinate policies covering responsible use, content moderation, privacy,
  and transparency. Understanding generative AI provides the context for more specialized
  concepts in this glossary, from attention mechanisms to red teaming.
audiences:
  exec: Generative AI is the class of systems that draft content on demand, automating
    creative and analytical tasks.
  engineer: Models that learn probability distributions over complex data and sample
    from them to produce new artifacts.
examples:
  do:
  - Pair generative AI deployments with clear disclosure and feedback channels for
    users.
  dont:
  - Launch generative features without documenting data sources, evaluation, and risk
    mitigations.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - risk_management
  risk_notes: Uncontrolled generative systems can leak sensitive data, create misleading
    content, or breach intellectual property.
