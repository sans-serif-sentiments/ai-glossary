short_def: Dense numerical representation that captures semantic meaning of text,
  images, or other data.
long_def: Embeddings map pieces of information—such as words, sentences, images, or
  audio—into dense vectors so similar concepts cluster in vector space. Modern foundation
  models learn embeddings during pretraining, optimizing them to capture contextual
  meaning, syntactic roles, and domain signals that make downstream tasks like retrieval,
  classification, and recommendation more effective. When teams build retrieval-augmented
  generation systems, they compute embeddings for documents and queries, then compare
  them with similarity metrics like cosine distance or dot product. The quality of
  those vectors influences whether the right context is retrieved, how well clustering
  and anomaly detection work, and how fast nearest-neighbor searches execute. Governance
  programs scrutinize embedding pipelines because biased or outdated vectors can encode
  harmful associations and propagate them into products. Maintaining embeddings thus
  requires dataset curation, versioning, and monitoring to detect drift as language
  or policies change.
audiences:
  exec: Embeddings are a way to translate concepts into numbers so the system can
    find and compare ideas efficiently.
  engineer: Model-generated vectors where distance metrics approximate semantic similarity;
    used for retrieval, clustering, ranking, and transfer learning.
examples:
  do:
  - Version embedding models and store associated tokenizer metadata to support reproducibility.
  dont:
  - Mix embeddings from different models without recalculating similarity thresholds
    or rescoring.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - data_quality
  - accountability
  risk_notes: Embedding drift or biased training data can surface discriminatory outputs
    when used in search or ranking.
