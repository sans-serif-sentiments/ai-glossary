short_def: Deterministic decoding that keeps the top scoring sequences across multiple
  beams before selecting the final output.
long_def: Beam search expands several candidate continuations in parallel, keeping
  only the highest-scoring sequences at each step according to their cumulative log
  probabilities. By exploring multiple beams instead of a single greedy path, the
  method can uncover higher-quality completions and reduce the chance of getting stuck
  in locally optimal—but globally poor—answers. Teams tune beam width and length penalties
  to balance diversity against compute cost, because wider beams demand more memory
  and latency. Product workflows that require structured or citation-heavy responses
  often pair beam search with reranking or guardrails to ensure final selections remain
  compliant. Engineers also log intermediate beams to debug why a response was chosen
  and to audit near-miss alternatives. Governance stakeholders review beam configurations
  in high-stakes deployments to confirm that deterministic choices align with evaluation
  baselines and do not inadvertently suppress required disclosures.
audiences:
  exec: Beam search is a quality knob—explore a few strong answer paths before picking
    the best one.
  engineer: Maintain N top-scoring sequences using cumulative log probabilities; apply
    length penalties and reranking before selecting the final candidate.
examples:
  do:
  - Monitor latency impact when increasing beam width beyond 4 to ensure SLAs still
    hold.
  - Analyze discarded beams during incident reviews to understand alternative outputs.
  dont:
  - Ship beam search without configuring length penalties, which can bias toward verbose
    responses.
  - Use the same beam width across all locales without measuring cost and accuracy
    trade-offs.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - robustness
  - transparency
  risk_notes: Misconfigured beams can surface repetitive or off-policy content; document
    parameters and align them with evaluation coverage.
