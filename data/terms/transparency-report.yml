short_def: Periodic disclosure that details how an AI system operates, what data it
  handles, and how risks are mitigated.
long_def: A transparency report is a structured publication that explains how an AI
  system was built, deployed, and governed. It typically documents training data provenance,
  safety mitigations, evaluation outcomes, incidents, and law-enforcement or policy
  interactions. Regulators increasingly require providers to publish these reports
  on a fixed cadence, while enterprises use them to demonstrate accountability to
  customers and civil society. Effective reports pair quantitative metrics with narrative
  context so stakeholders can understand both capabilities and limitations. Policy
  and legal teams coordinate the disclosure scope, communications tailors the narrative,
  and product owners provide operational detail. Without disciplined reporting, organizations
  struggle to prove compliance, respond to audits, or build trust with users.
audiences:
  exec: Use transparency reports to show regulators and customers that your AI program
    meets accountability expectations.
  engineer: 'Treat the report as a contract: ensure logs, metrics, and documentation
    can back every disclosure you publish.'
examples:
  do:

  - Describe data retention periods and consent mechanisms in plain language instead
    of legal shorthand.
  dont:
  - Release marketing copy that omits failure modes, known biases, or the limits of
    human oversight.
  - Bundle multiple system changes into one vague update that hides the timeline regulators
