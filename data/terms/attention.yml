part_of_speech: noun
short_def: Technique enabling models to weight input tokens differently when producing
  each output.
long_def: Attention assigns dynamic importance scores to tokens so a model can focus
  on the most relevant parts of the sequence when generating or interpreting outputs.
  In transformer architectures, self-attention computes query, key, and value projections
  that interact through scaled dot products, allowing every token to attend to every
  other token in the same layer. Multi-head attention repeats this operation across
  parallel subspaces, capturing nuanced relationships such as syntax, long-range dependencies,
  and positional context. The mechanism replaced recurrent networks for many language
  and vision tasks by enabling parallel processing and rich contextual reasoning.
  Engineers diagnose quality issues by inspecting attention patterns, tuning head
  counts, or constraining context windows to manage memory. Governance teams monitor
  attention configurations because they influence explainability—saliency maps and
  attribution methods often rely on attention weights to justify model decisions in
  regulated settings.
audiences:
  exec: Attention is how the model decides which words or pixels matter most before
    answering.
  engineer: QKV projections with softmax-normalized weights that let each token aggregate
    information from the entire sequence.
examples:
  do:
  - Profile attention head usage to identify redundant heads before applying pruning
    or distillation.
  dont:
  - Assume longer context windows automatically improve answers without verifying
    attention saturation and memory usage.
governance:
  nist_rmf_tags:
  - transparency
  - robustness
  risk_notes: Opaque attention patterns can hinder explainability obligations in regulated
    workflows.
