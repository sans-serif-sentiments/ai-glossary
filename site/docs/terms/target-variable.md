# target variable

**Aliases:** label, response variable
**Categories:** Foundations
**Roles:** Data Science & Research, Engineering & Platform, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `noun`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-10)

## Role takeaways
- **Data Science & Research:** Incorporate the metric or method into evaluation pipelines.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.

## Practice & apply
- Add this concept to onboarding materials so teammates share a common baseline.
- Link supporting research or documentation in your internal wiki for deeper study.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Outcome the model is trained to predict, providing the signal for calculating loss.

## Long definition
The target variable is the reference output used to evaluate model predictions during training and testing. In supervised learning it represents ground truth labels, such as fraud or not fraud, estimated price, or safety category. Accurate, consistent targets allow teams to compute loss functions, track metrics like precision and recall, and align models with business objectives. Product stakeholders define which real-world outcome matters most, while engineers and data scientists maintain labeling pipelines, quality checks, and access controls. Poorly governed targets undermine evaluation integrity and can encode bias, leading to misinformed decisions at launch.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** The target variable is the result we ask the model to get right so business decisions stay grounded.
- **Engineer:** Keep labeling guidelines versioned, audit quality, and map targets to downstream KPIs before training.

## Examples
**Do**
- Review labeling consistency across vendors before starting a new training run.
- Document how targets map to customer outcomes in the model card.

**Don't**
- Mix labels from incompatible taxonomies without reconciliation.
- Expose sensitive targets to broad teams without privacy controls.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** validity, fairness
- **Risk notes:** Low-quality target variables hide discrimination, inflate metrics, and break compliance attestations.

## Relationships
- **Related:** loss function, precision, recall, content moderation
