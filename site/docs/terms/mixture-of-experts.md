## Short definition
Neural architecture that routes tokens to specialized submodels to scale capacity efficiently.

## Long definition
Mixture-of-experts (MoE) models split a network into many expert submodels and use a gating function to decide which experts process each token. This allows models to increase parameter counts without running every computation for every input, improving efficiency and enabling specialization (e.g., code vs. dialogue experts). Engineers must manage load balancing, routing stability, and inference infrastructure that can handle sparse activation. Product teams care about how specialization affects consistency across use cases, and governance teams assess whether routing introduces bias or explainability challenges. Operationally, MoE systems demand robust logging to trace which experts contributed to an output for debugging and accountability.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** MoE architectures stretch compute budgets while boosting quality, but require investment in routing controls.
- **Engineer:** Monitor expert utilization, balance routing, and record which experts fired for auditability.

## Examples
**Do**
- Set guardrails for experts that handle sensitive domains like legal or medical content.
- Instrument per-expert performance metrics to catch degradation early.

**Don't**
- Assume routing is fair without analyzing demographic or domain skew.
- Deploy MoE models without redundancy plans for underperforming experts.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** monitoring, risk_management, transparency
- **Risk notes:** Opaque routing can hide failures or bias; sparse activation complicates reproducibility.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** fine-tuning
- **Related:** knowledge distillation, model interpretability, evaluation
