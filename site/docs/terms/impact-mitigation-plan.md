# impact mitigation plan

**Aliases:** mitigation roadmap, risk remediation plan
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Policy & Risk, Product & Program Managers, Legal & Compliance, Engineering & Platform
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-09)

## Role takeaways
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Action plan that tracks risks, mitigations, owners, and timelines for an AI deployment.

## Long definition
An impact mitigation plan documents the risks identified during assessments, the mitigation steps the organization will take, and the owners accountable for each action. It connects findings from algorithmic impact assessments, red-team exercises, and audits to specific deadlines, metrics, and escalation triggers. Policy leads maintain the plan to satisfy regulatory expectations, product teams map mitigations to launch gates, and engineering tracks the technical work needed to close gaps. When kept current, the plan provides a single source of truth for audits and post-incident reviews. When neglected, risks stay unaddressed and stakeholders lose visibility into whether controls are actually landing.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Use the mitigation plan to monitor whether high-severity risks are closing before committing to launch dates.
- **Engineer:** Link each mitigation to backlog tickets and telemetry so progress stays measurable and auditable.

## Examples
**Do**
- Record status updates and evidence links for every mitigation before major launch reviews.
- Flag blocked mitigations with escalation paths and decision deadlines for leadership.

**Don't**
- Let mitigation owners slip without documenting rationale or alternate controls.
- Track mitigations in private spreadsheets that governance teams cannot access.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** risk_management, accountability, monitoring
- **Risk notes:** Missing mitigation follow-through leaves organizations exposed to repeat incidents and regulatory penalties.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** algorithmic impact assessment, model governance
- **Related:** ai assurance, transparency report, risk register
