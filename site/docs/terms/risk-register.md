# risk register

**Aliases:** risk log, risk inventory
**Categories:** Governance & Risk
**Roles:** Policy & Risk, Product & Program Managers, Legal & Compliance, Engineering & Platform
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-09)

## Role takeaways
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Central list of identified AI risks, their owners, mitigations, and review status.

## Long definition
A risk register tracks every material risk an AI system poses, including potential harms, likelihood, impact, and planned mitigations. It links each item to an accountable owner, current status, and evidence such as evaluation results or assurance case references. Policy teams maintain the register for governance reviews, product owners prioritize fixes, engineering updates mitigation progress, and legal teams map entries to regulatory obligations. The register should be version-controlled and reviewed regularly; letting it go stale leaves leadership blind to emerging exposures.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Use the risk register as a single source of truth when approving launches or investments.
- **Engineer:** Update mitigation status promptly so policy partners can judge readiness accurately.

## Examples
**Do**
- Tag each risk with severity, detection method, and next review date.
- Link mitigations to evaluation artifacts and assurance case claims.

**Don't**
- Hide unresolved risks in private notes or disparate tools.
- Close a risk without capturing verification evidence.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** risk_management, accountability, governance
- **Risk notes:** Without a maintained register, teams miss systemic issues and fail audits.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** model governance
- **Related:** assurance case, impact mitigation plan, transparency report
