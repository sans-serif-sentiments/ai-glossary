**Part of speech:** `process`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-10)

## Role takeaways
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Practices that capture, honor, and audit user permissions across AI features.

## Long definition
Consent management ensures AI systems only process data in ways users or data subjects have authorized. It covers how organizations collect consent, represent it in data pipelines, respect withdrawal requests, and surface disclosures in product experiences. Legal and policy teams define the consent taxonomy, product teams design user flows, and engineers propagate consent flags through storage, training, and inference systems. Mature programs monitor for drift and provide regulators with evidence that consent was honored. Weak consent management risks privacy violations, regulatory fines, and erosion of customer trust.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Treat consent as an auditable control so expansion plans avoid regulatory setbacks.
- **Engineer:** Propagate consent metadata end-to-end and block models from accessing disallowed data.

## Examples
**Do**
- Record granular consent states and expiration dates for every data subject.
- Automate purge workflows when users revoke consent.

**Don't**
- Bundle broad AI permissions into generic terms-of-service text without explicit choice.
- Retrofit consent flags after data has already trained foundational models.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** privacy, accountability, governance
- **Risk notes:** Ignoring consent boundaries invites regulatory penalties and reputational harm.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** privacy, data minimization
- **Related:** impact mitigation plan, transparency report, risk register
