# validation set

**Aliases:** validation data, dev set
**Categories:** Foundations
**Roles:** Data Science & Research, Engineering & Platform, Product & Program Managers
**Part of speech:** `noun`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-10)

## Role takeaways
- **Data Science & Research:** Incorporate the metric or method into evaluation pipelines.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.

## Practice & apply
- Add this concept to onboarding materials so teammates share a common baseline.
- Link supporting research or documentation in your internal wiki for deeper study.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Dataset slice used to tune hyperparameters and compare experiments without touching the test set.

## Long definition
The validation set provides an unbiased checkpoint during model development. After fitting on the training data, teams gauge performance on this held-out split to choose architectures, hyperparameters, and stopping criteria. A disciplined validation strategy prevents information leakage into the final test set, offering a realistic signal of how design choices will play out in production. Product leaders rely on validation metrics to weigh accuracy against latency or cost trade-offs, while engineers track subgroup results to guard against bias. Clear documentation of validation protocol, refresh cadence, and governance sign-off keeps experiment logs reproducible and audit ready.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Validation data is the dress rehearsal that tells us if the model is ready before the final exam.
- **Engineer:** Keep validation slices immutable, monitor for drift, and reset them when feature space or labeling rules change.

## Examples
**Do**
- Log every hyperparameter trial that reads the validation set to maintain experiment lineage.
- Audit validation performance across protected cohorts before promoting a model.

**Don't**
- Tune against the test set or stack multiple validations from overlapping data.
- Treat validation metrics as final sign-off without human review or business context.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** robustness, accountability
- **Risk notes:** Mismanaged validation data masks overfitting and governance gaps, leading to unexpected failures after launch.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** cross-validation
- **Related:** generalization, training data, regularization, evaluation
