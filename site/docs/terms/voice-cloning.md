## Role takeaways
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Communications & Enablement:** Align messaging, FAQs, and enablement materials using this definition.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Security & Trust:** Plan monitoring and abuse prevention scenarios influenced by this term.

## Practice & apply
- Add this concept to onboarding materials so teammates share a common baseline.
- Link supporting research or documentation in your internal wiki for deeper study.
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Technique that replicates a person’s voice using generative models trained on audio samples.

## Long definition
Voice cloning systems learn a speaker’s vocal characteristics from recorded samples and synthesize new speech that mimics that voice. Modern approaches use encoder-decoder architectures, diffusion models, or transformer-based TTS pipelines conditioned on speaker embeddings. While voice cloning powers accessibility, localization, and creative tools, it also raises serious risks: impersonation, fraud, misinformation, and consent violations. Product teams must obtain clear user permissions and provide safeguards like watermarks or audible disclosures. Legal and policy teams assess compliance with biometric privacy laws and emerging deepfake regulations. Security groups monitor abuse signals and coordinate rapid takedowns when clones are misused. Transparency, usage logs, and red-team exercises are essential for trustworthy deployment.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Voice cloning lets you generate speech that sounds like a real person—but it needs strict guardrails.
- **Engineer:** Extract speaker embeddings, condition neural TTS or diffusion decoders, and enforce consent, watermarking, and usage logs.

## Examples
**Do**
- Require opt-in consent and verification before training on a person’s voice.
- Embed inaudible watermarks and provide detection tools to partners.

**Don't**
- Release cloning features without a response plan for malicious use.
- Store raw recordings longer than necessary or without encryption.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** risk_management, transparency
- **Risk notes:** Misuse of voice cloning can lead to fraud, reputational harm, and regulatory penalties; strict access controls and auditing are mandatory.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** generative ai
- **Related:** synthetic data, content moderation, incident response
