# model card

**Aliases:** model documentation, model datasheet
**Categories:** Governance & Risk, Operations & Monitoring
**Roles:** Policy & Risk, Legal & Compliance, Product & Program Managers, Engineering & Platform, Communications & Enablement
**Part of speech:** `noun`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-09)

!!! tip "Put it into practice"
    Document changes using the [Governance & Risk section](../categories.md#governance--risk).

## Role takeaways
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.
- **Product & Program Managers:** Translate this concept into user impact and rollout plans.
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Communications & Enablement:** Align messaging, FAQs, and enablement materials using this definition.

## Practice & apply
- Map this term to the governance dashboard and record accountable owners in the backlog.
- Review current regulatory guidance or internal policy notes linked from the resources page before sign-off.
- Instrument dashboards or alerts that reflect the metrics highlighted in this definition.
- Update incident response or on-call runbooks with the glossary's do/don't scenarios.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Standardized documentation describing a model’s purpose, data, performance, and limitations.

## Long definition
A model card summarizes key information about an AI system, including intended use, training data sources, evaluation results (overall and across subgroups), known limitations, safety mitigations, and contact points for escalation. Model cards support transparency, reproducibility, and compliance by giving stakeholders a shared reference that travels with each release. Product managers and engineers co-author model cards during the development lifecycle, updating them after retraining, prompt changes, or mitigation work. Policy, legal, and communications teams rely on model cards to inform disclosures, customer messaging, and regulatory filings. Mature organizations treat model cards as living documents stored in version control, with automated checks verifying that new releases update relevant sections.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** A model card is the product brief that explains what the AI is for, how it was built, and where it might misfire.
- **Engineer:** Document data lineage, evaluation metrics, ethical considerations, and change history; keep cards versioned alongside code.

## Examples
**Do**
- Include subgroup metrics and fairness assessments in every model card.
- Link to evaluation artifacts, incident history, and responsible AI approvals.

**Don't**
- Publish a model without a card—reviewers and regulators will ask for it.
- Let model cards go stale; update them whenever prompts or data shift.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** documentation, accountability
- **Risk notes:** Missing or outdated model cards hinder audits and can delay approvals or trigger compliance findings.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** model governance
- **Related:** responsible ai, privacy impact assessment, evaluation
