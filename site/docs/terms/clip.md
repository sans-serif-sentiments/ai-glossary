## Short definition
Multimodal model that embeds images and text into a shared space using contrastive learning.

## Long definition
CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) jointly trains an image encoder and a text encoder so that semantically related images and captions map to nearby vectors. The approach uses large-scale image-text pairs scraped from the web and optimizes a contrastive loss that pushes matching pairs together while separating non-matching ones. Once trained, CLIP can perform zero-shot classification, retrieval, and multimodal search by comparing similarity between embeddings. Product teams leverage CLIP to improve content moderation, recommendation, and creative tooling without task-specific labels. Engineers integrate CLIP embeddings into vector stores or downstream fine-tuning pipelines, paying attention to bias, licensing, and safety constraints inherited from web-scale training data. Communications and policy teams monitor CLIP use because it can expose cultural biases and sensitive associations unless mitigated through filtering and evaluation.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** CLIP understands images and text together, letting you search or classify visuals using natural language.
- **Engineer:** Encode images and text with separate transformers trained via contrastive loss; use cosine similarity for retrieval, zero-shot classification, or RAG pipelines.

## Examples
**Do**
- Audit embeddings for demographic bias before deploying search or moderation features.
- Cache CLIP embeddings and align them with domain-specific prompts to improve precision.

**Don't**
- Assume CLIP is license-clean; review dataset provenance and usage restrictions.
- Ignore safety filters when exposing CLIP-powered features to end users.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** data_quality, transparency
- **Risk notes:** CLIP inherits web-scale bias and copyright concerns; record how outputs are filtered and evaluated.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** embedding
- **Related:** retrieval, synthetic data, guardrails
