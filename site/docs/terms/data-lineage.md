# data lineage

**Aliases:** lineage tracking, data provenance
**Categories:** Operations & Monitoring
**Roles:** Engineering & Platform, Data Science & Research, Policy & Risk, Legal & Compliance
**Part of speech:** `noun_phrase`
**Status:** <span class="status-chip status-approved">Approved</span> (Last reviewed: 2025-10-09)

## Role takeaways
- **Engineering & Platform:** Document implementation requirements and operational caveats.
- **Data Science & Research:** Incorporate the metric or method into evaluation pipelines.
- **Policy & Risk:** Map the definition to governance controls and review checklists.
- **Legal & Compliance:** Assess contractual and regulatory obligations tied to this term.

## Practice & apply
- Instrument dashboards or alerts that reflect the metrics highlighted in this definition.
- Update incident response or on-call runbooks with the glossary's do/don't scenarios.
- Share takeaways with the accountable roles listed above so actions land with the right owners.

## Short definition
Traceable record of how data moves, transforms, and is used across AI systems.

## Long definition
Data lineage maps the lifecycle of data from ingestion through processing, training, evaluation, and deployment. It records sources, transformations, storage locations, and downstream consumers so teams can audit usage, troubleshoot quality issues, and respond to regulatory requests. Engineering automates lineage capture in pipelines, data scientists log transformations in notebooks, and policy teams use lineage to verify compliance with consent and retention rules. Effective lineage feeds governance dashboards, reminds owners to retire obsolete datasets, and documents which models rely on each asset. Without lineage, it is difficult to honor deletion requests, explain model behavior, or investigate incidents.

## Audience perspectives
- **Exec:** Treat lineage as foundational infrastructure for audit readiness and trust.
- **Engineer:** Instrument pipelines to emit lineage metadata and expose it via searchable catalogs.

## Examples
**Do**
- Link training datasets to their upstream sources and associated dataset cards.
- Tag lineage records with retention and consent attributes.

**Don't**
- Rely on tribal knowledge to track where sensitive data flows.
- Break lineage chains when copying data to ad hoc storage.

## Governance
- **NIST RMF tags:** accountability, governance, risk_management
- **Risk notes:** Absent lineage hides policy violations and slows incident RCA.

## Relationships
- **Broader:** ml ops
- **Related:** consent management, dataset card, risk register
