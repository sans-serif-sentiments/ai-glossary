    <h2>Shared language for AI builders and stewards</h2>
    <p>
      Every term in the glossary is citation-backed, audience-aware, and stored as
      structured YAML so it can power docs, APIs, and review workflows. Browse by
      category, role, or metric to keep product, engineering, and governance teams in sync.

## Project focus

- **Shared language:** harmonizes terminology across technical, product, and policy stakeholders.
- **Structured delivery:** each entry lives in YAML with examples, aliases, and governance context for downstream reuse.
- **Traceable sources:** every definition includes citations, NIST AI RMF tags, and lifecycle status for auditability.

## Current features

- Seed coverage for foundational concepts spanning large language models, retrieval, MLOps, and governance.
- Automated validation that enforces schema rules, definition length limits, and audience-specific explanations before publication.
- Generated JSON datasets (`build/glossary.json`, `build/search-index.json`) and Markdown documentation (`site/docs/terms/`) derived from the same YAML source.
- Categorized navigation so visitors can browse by LLM internals, retrieval, optimization, operations, or governance topics.
- Role starter packs and a guided search experience so product, engineering, policy, legal, security, and communications teams can find relevant terms fast.

## Deep-dive resources

- [External source catalog](resources.md) — official glossaries and standards to cite.
- [Governance dashboard](governance-dashboard.md) — metrics, NIST coverage, and intake guidance.
- [Prompt engineering playbook](prompting.md) — practical workflows for shaping model behaviour.

??? tip "Need a fast orientation?"
    - Start with the **role starter packs** to see the glossary through stakeholder lenses.
    - Use the **interactive search** to filter by status, category, or review freshness.
    - Link YAML entries directly into internal tooling—the schema is stable and versioned.
