- **Top categories:** Governance & Risk (42), LLM Core (26), Operations & Monitoring (19)
- **Most represented roles:** Product (98 terms), Engineering (98), Policy & Data Science (60 each)

## NIST RMF coverage by tag

| NIST tag | Representative terms | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Accuracy | [hallucination](terms/hallucination.md), [precision](terms/precision.md) | Ensure evaluation suites report precision/recall alongside hallucination incidents. |
| Fairness | [algorithmic bias](terms/algorithmic-bias.md), [fairness metrics](terms/fairness-metrics.md) | Align fairness thresholds with policy requirements and document in model cards. |
| Transparency | [model interpretability](terms/model-interpretability.md), [model card](terms/model-card.md) | Capture explanation tooling and documentation updates before launch. |
| Privacy | [data minimization](terms/data-minimization.md), [privacy impact assessment](terms/privacy-impact-assessment.md), [data retention](terms/data-retention.md) | Validate retention schedules and PIA sign-offs for new features. |
| Risk Management | [content moderation](terms/content-moderation.md), [voice cloning](terms/voice-cloning.md) | Review incident response playbooks and escalation paths for emerging risks. |
| Documentation | [model card](terms/model-card.md), [model governance](terms/model-governance.md) | Keep model cards and governance logs up to date with each release. |

## Quick tasks for governance partners

1. Review the [Role Starter Pack for Policy & Risk](roles.md#policy--risk) and ensure open tasks are assigned.
2. For each upcoming launch, record fairness, privacy, and interpretability decisions in the appropriate glossary term relationships (e.g., link mitigation plans under “related”).
3. Schedule quarterly audits of the [Category Explorer](categories.md#governance--risk) to confirm coverage is current and identify new terms to add.
4. Use the [interactive search](search.md?category=Governance%20%26%20Risk) with the status filter to prioritize review queues.

## Intake & backlog signals

- **Incoming requests:** Monitor submissions from the [term intake form](term-request.md) and tag them for governance review as needed.
- **Backlog priorities:** The [keyword backlog](keyword-backlog.md#compliance--assurance) highlights assurance, audit, and transparency terms awaiting owners.
- **Review cadence:** Add backlog review as a standing agenda item for the governance or risk council so high-impact drafts move toward approval.
